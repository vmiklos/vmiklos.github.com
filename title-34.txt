now we have git support in darcs (it does not causes any extra dep ;) ), here is a short demo, how does it works:
<pre>$ cg-clone http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git</pre>
this will fetch a git repo for you, as dr get does not works yet (i <a href="http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/DarcsGit">don't see</a> if this is planned or not), but then do a <pre>cd git; dr changes --last=5</pre> and it really works fine :)
