ok, this post will be a big generic, but it seems this is still totally new to some people. so, the Message-ID header in an email is ideally unique and you can easily use it to refer to an email in an other discussion.

in this post i want to deal with 3 issues:

first, how to display it in your mail client. ok, this depends on your mue, in mutt, you need to add <pre>unignore message-id</pre> to your muttrc.

second, if you want to search for a message-id in a folder, that's your mua's task as well. in mutt, you can do it by for example <pre>~i 200804281829.11866.henrikau@orakel.ntnu.no</pre>

the third trick isn't mua-specific. if you want to link the message, and the list is indexed by gmane, then you can just type <pre>http://mid.gmane.org/200804281829.11866.henrikau@orakel.ntnu.no</pre> and it'll redirect to <pre>http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/80566</pre>

ok, that's all for today :)
