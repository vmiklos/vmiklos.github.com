Once I was ready with this year's GSoC work I started to submit it back
to OpenOffice.org. Before that was completed, LibreOffice was launched,
though I thought if I started working on submitting it to OpenOffice.org
as well, I'll finish it. About 6 weeks later they now
http://hg.services.openoffice.org/DEV300/rev/5a2d87e7a414[integrated]
(merged) the `vmiklos01` CWS (the branch containing my GSoC work) to
DEV300, what will became OpenOffice.org 3.4 later.
