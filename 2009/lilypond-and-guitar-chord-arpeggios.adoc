<p>Of course I have no idea if this is the right name of this stuff, to make long story short, I finally found a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.lilypond.general/44348">workaround</a> to display this beast in lilypond. Yay!</p><p>This project is really addictive, you can spend a whole day reading its documentation and you still just say "wow, this and even that is possible with this stufff". ;-)</p>
