title: Successful qemu-ppc install with frugalware-current

Tonight I synced the 2.6.28 kernel on PPC, enabled the Realtek driver
needed by Qemu and tried again: the whole installation procedure goes
fine.

Of course (it couldn't be true ;) ) the boot after the install fails,
which is interesting - if boot from CD works fine, I don't see why can't
it work from a HDD, but oh well.

I just saw a recent commit in Qemu SVN about fixing qemu-system-ppc
-kernel, so I'll give it a try later.

Ah, and the speed is really promising. I did the installation on my
laptop, not on a fast machine, and a base install really completed not
so slow. ;)

Update: After upgrading to svn6463, it boots with:

----
qemu-system-ppc -kernel boot/vmlinux-2.6.28-fw1-ppc -append "ro root=/dev/hda3" -hda ~/documents/qemu/hda.img
----

\o/

Update 2: Up to date install/run ppc scripts http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/virt/[here].
