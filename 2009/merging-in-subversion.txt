I'm just talking about 1.5+, since before that version it's like there would be not git merge, just git cherry-pick. (You had to explicitly specify each revision. That's not merging.)

A quick howto is <a href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=92">here</a>.

A command which may be useful but left out is like 'git log master..branch', to see what revisions will be merged:

<pre>
$ time svn mergeinfo https://swig.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swig/trunk/ \
--show-revs eligible
(...)
real    0m14.902s
user    0m0.155s
sys     0m0.013s
</pre>

Well, it's getting better, but as the blog post says it's still not git-like.

Actually it's horribly slow, I'm still waiting for 'svn merge https://swig.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swig/trunk/' to finish. ;-)
