<p>Funny, when there is a maintenance on launchpad, they just filter the ssh port on the server, so you get:</p><p><pre>ssh: connect to host bazaar.launchpad.net port 22: Connection timed out</pre></p><p>Snip. I spent my time earlier today to make package moves in FST easier. Finally I modified the checkout plugin of our git hook framework so that if a FrugalBuild is moved from one dir to another, then the other files from the old dir are moved to the new dir as well.</p>
