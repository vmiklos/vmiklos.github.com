<p>So a friend of mine showed that he has an offline map on his non-smart phone. A googled for mgmaps and figured out how to use it as well, but it wasn't really trivial, so I'm collecting some links here.</p><p>First, you need the mgmaps midlet itself. I read that the KML support (ie importing favorites) has been improved in the development version, so I tried that one.</p><p>Given that you must have a signed jar (or otherwise you'll get a question each time you scroll the map), I just went to <a href="http://wap.mgmaps.com/">this page</a> and downloaded the signed devel midlet from there.</p><p>The second one was to download the maps I'm interested in, without using the expensive GPRS connection.</p><p>First I generated the .map file, using <a href="http://www.mapcacher.com/">this page</a>. It's really just about generating a descriptor file which contains the coordinates, wished zoom level and map type.</p><p>The second step is to actually download the maps based on the descriptor file. I haven't played too much with this, the .net <a href="http://www.mgmaps.com/cache/">gmapmaker</a> app did the job fine. Yes, a cmdline, opensource app would be better, but I don't really care.</p><p>Now if I have a GPS coordinate, I can search for it off-line on my map, as long as it's in Hungary. :) (And the whole map is about 300MB, as I have the map for Budapest with an extra zoom level.)</p><p>The third part is about transfering the google maps directions feature to the phone: ie getting the directions on google maps, saving it to a kml file, and using it off-line (for free) on the phone.</p><p>This is partly implemented. See <a href="http://forum.mgmaps.com/viewtopic.php?p=12473">this thread</a> on how to save the KML file. There is no nice blue line ATM for the directions (but they are <a href="http://forum.mgmaps.com/viewtopic.php?p=14330">working on it</a>), but apart from that, you have everything.</p><p>And yes, this is completely free (if you count the .net app, then only as in beer). :)</p>
