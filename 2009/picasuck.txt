<p>I just wrote a short script (named after cvsuck that can download a whole CVS repo with anon access only) that can download a whole picasa album without installing any firefox extension, binary software from Google, etc.</p><p>It's available <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/bash/picasuck">here</a>.</p>
