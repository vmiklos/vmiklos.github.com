<p>It's actually qemu that calls these port redirects, but I don't know the proper generic name. So what I was needed is that a service runs inside virtualbox and I want to have it on the host machine as well. For now I just wanted the same port, but for ssh obviously I want an other one, since ssh is probably already running on the host machine. ;-)</p><p>A good howto is available <a href="http://sk.c-wd.net/wp/2008/01/05/virtualbox-port-forwarding-with-linux-host/">here</a>. And <a href="http://mydebian.blogdns.org/?p=148">here</a> is an other one, in case later one of them would be 404. :-P</p>
