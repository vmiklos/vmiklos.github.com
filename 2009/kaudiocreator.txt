I just got an audio CD and they wanted me to grab it (copy+compress to mp3). I think last time I did so about 8 years ago? :) Those days I used xfce and I used first grip then I wrote a perl script that used lame, cdparanoia, mp3info and cdlabelgen (it lacked cddb support).

Of course I did not maintain my script so it stopped working with the updated upstream tools, so I was searching something simple, like grip but preferably a qt/kde one.

When I inserted the audio CD, it offered to compress it, it started KAudioCreator. And yes, the usual kde quality, it just worked. :)
