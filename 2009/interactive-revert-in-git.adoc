<p>It's a long time since 'dg rev' could be replaced by 'git checkout -p', but that feature was missing from git.git. In the near past it <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commit;h=54f0bdc81103f45f12978b385a9519a235b03cc2">got implemented</a> and you can even avoid hitting enter after every y/n by saying:</p><p><pre>git config interactive.singlekey true</pre></p><p>One less feature which is unique to dg! (In the long run it would be nice if I could stop recommending its usage to users.)</p>
