I recently started using <a href="http://picasup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/picUp/src/picup/picu.py">picu</a>, which is a nice tool (I just mirror pictures at Picasa as I like the comment/notify/label features of it.), but it had two annoying bugs (no proper header and too gmail-centric), so I sent <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/picu-nogmail.patch">this patch</a> upstream today.

Heh, and this is the 100th hacking post. So far it seems it was not a bad idea, I can search back "what did I hack on 22th", and sometimes I can link posts from here as a HOWTO, so writing it in English was a good decision.
