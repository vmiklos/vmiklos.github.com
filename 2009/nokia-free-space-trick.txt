I hit this issue a few times, but now I took the time to Google it out. So when I download lots of music to my Nokia 3110c phone, I keeps restarting because the Nokia version of OOM killer terminates the music indexer process. Given that it's a vital process (I don't know the proper term for this), the phone is restarted. It does this sequence about 5 times, then it just switches off.

The trick is to delay indexing, if it does so a bit later after the phone boot is already done, it can succeed properly. The hack is to <a href="http://discussions.europe.nokia.com/discussions/board/message?board.id=hardware&amp;thread.id=6149">limit the internal memory free space</a>, that will trigger this delay:

<blockquote>
Now Keep ur free Phone memory space [Not the memory card's free space]
between 470kb - 499kb
</blockquote>

The style is horrible, but the info is useful, after setting free space like this, it can really handled large amount of music fine. ;)
