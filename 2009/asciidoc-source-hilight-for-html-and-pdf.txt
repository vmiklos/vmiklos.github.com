Long time no blog, mainly because I'm pretty busy with real life.

So yesterday I got an answer on the asciidoc list about how to do C++ source hilighting that works with html and pdf output as well. The problem is that source-highlight (used for html) and docbook have a different name for this crappy language.

The solution was to do

<pre>
:cpp: {basebackend@docbook:c++:cpp}
</pre>

Which says "if docbook, then c++ otherwise cpp", and then I can just use

<pre>
[source,{cpp}]
----
code
----
</pre>

Yay!
