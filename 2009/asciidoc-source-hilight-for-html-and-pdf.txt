<p>Long time no blog, mainly because I'm pretty busy with real life.</p><p>So yesterday I got an answer on the asciidoc list about how to do C++ source hilighting that works with html and pdf output as well. The problem is that source-highlight (used for html) and docbook have a different name for this crappy language.</p><p>The solution was to do</p><p><pre>
:cpp: {basebackend@docbook:c++:cpp}
</pre></p><p>Which says "if docbook, then c++ otherwise cpp", and then I can just use</p><p><pre>
[source,{cpp}]

code

</pre></p><p>Yay!</p>
