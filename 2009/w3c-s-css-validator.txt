I wasted almost 8 hours with trying to get it working from CVS, no luck so far.

OK, I'm not a Java wizard, but.. most buildtime and runtime errors can be solved by scanning the list archives, but finally the Apache template engine it uses really can't initialize itself.

I started to debug it, but working with CVS is really a pain, so I want to set up a git mirror first, then hopefully I can send my results till now to the w3c css list, and ask for help.

Sigh. Java is still a pain.
