Still preparing for my 'Computer Networks' exam, so I did not do much coding.

LGee just uploaded a few new pictures about his servers, and there are two interesting ones. ;-)

First is <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/rhdisk0/Computers#5285256724895614178">this one</a>. And then yes, I must agree that some mainboards are really can't be used a server.

This <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/rhdisk0/Computers#5285256994899547394">other one</a> is just interesting - first we though that's a bug in the Frugalware ppc installer, then later it turned out to be a generic Linux-ppc issue.
