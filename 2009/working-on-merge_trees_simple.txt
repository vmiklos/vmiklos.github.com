I just pushed out these <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/git/vmiklos.git?a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/merge-tree">four commits</a>. Basically they let a libgit user use the functionality which was hardwired to git-merge-tree till now. The idea is from Dscho, so I hope the patches will be welcomed. ;-)

(I did not sent out any patches for now, since my ls-files parseopt patch isn't in yet, either.)

Ah and we talked about (in case I'll be home during the summer) if I should re-apply for git in GSoC. Basically I don't want to do it, but I'm very happy that my ex-mentor even recommends me not doing so. Here are his lines:

<blockquote>
> About reapplying for Git... I would _love_ to have you again, since I know
> you will get stuff done, and in a very nice way.
>
> There is always a but.
>
> But.  Realistically, I think that you learnt so many things in the GSoC
> project last year, that you do not really have all that much left which
> you could learn in the Git community.  You really just would be a work
> horse.
>
> There are other projects out there who do fantastic and exciting things,
> and have completely different personal (and political!) environments.
>
> So while the Git community member says "keep him!", the mentor in me says
> "let him go!" albeit with half a sad eye.
>
> Therefore I am strong and point you to http://code.google.com/soc/2008; I
> even met some of the guys at the mentor summit, and they are all pretty
> cool.
</blockquote>

These lines made me happy, really. :-)
