<p>This story is a couple of days old, but in case you don't use Frugalware, and have such an Intel card, it may be interesting...</p><p>Here is the <a href="http://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25417">bugreport</a>, it took me about 1,5 days to bisect it, but at the end at least I have a workaround for the issue.</p><p>Given that now Gordon Jin from Intel set its priority to high, I'm curious how long will it take for them to provide a solution.</p><p>The sad part of it is that mplayer -vo xv still does not work, but the gl output is not so terrible, after all.</p>
