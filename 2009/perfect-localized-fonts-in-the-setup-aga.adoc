<p>We had this problem recently that on the console the fonts were not entirely correct, for example lat2-16.psfu.gz was replaced by lat2a-16.psfu.gz. I finally found why it was still broken in the setup: I forgot to update the Makefile to include the new font in the initrd. ;-)</p><p>Now the fonts are perfect again.</p>
