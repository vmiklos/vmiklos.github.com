<p>I finished the update to 2.6.28 (I mean fixing external modules) in a WIP repo, will merge it tonight, if everything goes fine.</p><p>OTOH it turns out that the net in qemu-ppc is disabled because the driver is disabled in the ppc config. So I'll have to enable those drivers when I sync.</p><p>Oh and a trick. mplayer -vo null -vc null will stop playing audio if video finishes earlier. mplayer -novideo won't. So that'll be the solution for my "sample music gets truncated in an flv-wav-mp3 conversion" problem. ;)</p><p>Finally the W3C css validator guys are nice, see <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.org.w3c.validator.css/2346">this thread</a>, basically it works fine now! :)</p>
