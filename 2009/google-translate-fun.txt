<p>I never imagined that google translate could be useful for any situation when English is not the source language (I use it when English is the target language when I find some Chinese or Japanese blog posts), but now I see where it can be useful.</p><p>Yesterday I just wanted to link a timeline to someone who does not speak English at all, and google translate did its jobs - at least when the user knew what does she search for, she was able to find the date in the timeline. :)</p>
