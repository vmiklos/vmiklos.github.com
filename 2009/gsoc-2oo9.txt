They just <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/program/home/google/gsoc2009">announced</a> the list of accepted orgs for gsoc 2k9, I'm happy to see that SWIG is accepted as well - they have an interesting PHP project.

The mentor who is interested in the project lives in GMT+13, so I have to try contacting him later today...
