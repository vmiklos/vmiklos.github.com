<p>So iwiw.net has some flash + js interface to upload photos, but it seems firefox just segfaults here when I want to upload ones. Good idea, I should not bother with doing so.</p><p>I've wrote a <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/ly/pdfgen.sh">small script</a> to merge all the lilypond PDFs I have to a single one. Far from perfect, but it's a start.</p><p>I've just found <a href="http://marginalhacks.com/Hacks/album/">album</a>. It's an HTML index + thumbnail generator, it's a bit bloated, but it's not hard to tell it you don't want any extra features. Just downloading the script to $HOME/bin is enough and it can live without downloading any bloated themes.</p><p>Ah and the <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.frugalware.devel/6530/focus=6531">thread</a> on fw-dev about the intel driver vs kms just sucks. I don't have time to build 2.6.32rc1 right now...</p>
