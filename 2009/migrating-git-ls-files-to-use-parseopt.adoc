<p>People say that using bitfields in structs is slow. Of course it reduces memory usage, but the aritmetic is slower than just using pointers.</p><p>But my real problem is that if a struct uses bitfields, I can't just pass foo-&gt;bar as a pointer. And I hate that. When migrating ls-files to parseopt, I needed to write 3 extra callback functions just because of this.</p><p>Grr.</p>
