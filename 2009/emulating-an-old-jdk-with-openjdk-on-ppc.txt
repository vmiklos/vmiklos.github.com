<p>Okay, so this was a bit tricky, I was about to give it up, but then after 2 hours of RTFMing I got the solution. ;)</p><p>The goal was to emulate jdk1.3 with openjdk.</p><p>The first trick is to enable the binfmt_misc handler of qemu, as you'll need jre1.3, and the self-extractor of it is an i386 code. pacman -S qemu, service qemu start should do it.</p><p>The rest is just a Makefile, something like <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/bme/8/itlabor1/1/Makefile">this</a>.</p><p>It was tricky to figure out the right options for the postprocessor (as I was using an odbms) options as well, but that's not a so interesting problem anyway.</p>
