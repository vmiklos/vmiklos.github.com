So we got <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3678">this</a> bugreport yesterday, and I wasn't able to reproduce it on my x86 box, but I saw it on my iBook. It turns out that LESSCHARSET, which I set just for git, handles this case for me as well. At least after setting it, the manpage is correct on my iBook as well.

The weird thing is that it's still wrong for crazy@ - though I don't know if this will solve the problem of the reporter or not.

I started working on a new song in lilypond, I still like it, though no idea so far how to display a simple "A^4", it seems "a:4" does something much more complicated. ;)
