So lilypond is a really geek-friendly project to produce music notation from text-based files. It has its own cryptic language. I spent a half day playing with it, so I'm not an expert at all, but I achieved something. ;-)

The example song I wanted to describe is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hLarHt6wi8">cantina band</a> from starwars.

To make the long story short, here is the <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/music/cantina-band/cantina-band.txt">asciidoc source</a>, the <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/music/cantina-band/Makefile">Makefile</a>, and the <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/music/cantina-band">result</a>.
