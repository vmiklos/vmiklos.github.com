<p>If someone is a major contributor in a project, it's always funny to search back the VCS logs to see what was the first contribution. Usually a typo fix or a oneliner patch.</p><p>Partly related, cleanups are usually done by major contributors, so a cleanup is typically not e "first patch". Unless we are talking about me and <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/gitmagic.git?a=commitdiff;h=abd5709ce87737e37de8edaf39b1cb2bda520a0b">gitmagic</a>.</p><p>The funny story is that my first patch is really just about removing two parts of the book. Both were listed as "known git bugs", one was solved a long time ago, and I just fixed the other one a few days ago.</p>
