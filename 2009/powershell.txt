<p>I just experimented a bit with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/powershell/default.mspx">powershell</a>, it's funny that if you know bash and perl, you'll know a lot in powershell as well. ;)</p><p>Also, they made a lot of unix aliases, so there is man, ls, mv, etc. in it. That as bad as I expected...</p>
