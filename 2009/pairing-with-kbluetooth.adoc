<p>Here is the use case I saw: I try to run 'gammu identify' from commandline, it finds my phone, the phone asks if I want to pair with my notebook, I say yes, it asks for a pin code, and whatever I answer, the pairing fails.</p><p>Looks like the way it works is the other direction: start kbluetooth, choose settings, devices, then set the mode to discoverable (for 3 mins, that should be enough). Then go to paired devices on the phone, choose delete pairing, then add the notebook again, it will ask for a pin and pairing will succeed.</p><p>A bit weird, but it works at least.</p>
