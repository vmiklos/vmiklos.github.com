<p>It's out, the only recent change is that I added a new setting to be able to see what is the raw stream BitlBee received. The other interesting part is that after the release I finally decided to split up that huge read callback and now each part is handled by a separate function, and I have a nice array of function pointers. BTW, this also made checkpatch happy about skype.c without doing hacks like:</p><p><pre>
printf("%s %s",
        foo,
        bar);
</pre></p><p>Which would really just make the code ugly.</p><p>Yay! :)</p>
