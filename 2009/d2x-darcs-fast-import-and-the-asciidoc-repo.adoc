I proposed a https://code.launchpad.net/~vmiklos/bzr-fastimport/darcs/+merge/11406[new merge] for bzr-fastimport with the following hilights:

- darcs-fast-import can now import the asciidoc hg repo
- d2x -f hg (which converts a darcs repo to a hg one) now works with hg 1.3, and without my hg
  fastimport fork. The later is something I'm really happy about, because I hated recommending my hg
  fastimport patches, not being a hg person. :)
