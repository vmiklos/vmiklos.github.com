I just had to notice that recently the altgr key (right apple button) on my iBook does not work in GTK apps. But it does in QT ones. Of course. ;-)

Though this time it was not a GTK bug but an xorg one.

Now that these days we have git bisect, it was trivial to find the <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xkeyboard-config/commit/?id=5de02aa07a8d4bbe1957af3a38212c3507f2436f">bad commit</a>, though to make bug-hunting still fun, there were numerous xorg modules to poke before I finally figured out this will be an xkeyboard-config bug.
