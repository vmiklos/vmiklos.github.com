<p><div align="center"><img src="http://www.livedemo.com/scripts/b2evo/blogs/img/b2evolution_logo.png" title="" alt="" height="50%" width="50%" /></div></p><p>I had an "upgrade to latest b2evo 2.x stable" on my TODO for a long time and then I realized that I would have to upgrade to 3.x. That's a nightmare, when I switched from 1.x to 2.x it took a few days till I ported my patchset to the new major version. Now that these days I don't care about details so much, I just decided to drop my hacks and return to the vanilla b2evo. This way the upgrade took only about 5 mins and as a side effect my 'hacking' posts are included on the main page as well.</p>
