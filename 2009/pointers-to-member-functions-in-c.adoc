<p>Okay, I learned something new, you can have a special pointer type in C++ which is not really a pointer at all.</p><p>So let's say you have a Foo class with a lot of void foo(int param); methods. Then you can have a "pointer" type 'int (Foo::*)(int)' which is in fact a pointer to Foo and it has an offset about what function does it point to.</p><p>And given that it contains an address and an offset as well, you can't cast it to void*, like you can do so with real pointers.</p><p>I had to look up the Bjarne book since I didn't really know about this at all... ;-)</p>
