<p>Now that I know a little bit more about Erlang I checked how to configure vhosts with ejabberd. It turns out it's quite trivial once you understand the syntax of the config file, which is just eval'd, so it has this horrible (for an outsider) syntax. ;)</p><p>Actually configuring vhosts are just about adding the new host to the DNS and adding it to /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg, like:</p><p>{hosts, ["mydomain.org", "another.com"]}.</p><p>And that's all you need. Simple, isn't it? :)</p>
