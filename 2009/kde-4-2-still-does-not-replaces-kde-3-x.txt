I just found a nice sentence in a <a href="http://commit-digest.org/issues/2009-02-08/">commit-digest</a>, released <em>after</em> KDE 4.2 was out:

<blockquote>
Work on porting KControl and Konversation to KDE 4.
</blockquote>

Wow. Let's say I just use kdebase from KDE 3. Now, kcontrol is part of kdebase. So it's nice we already have kmail and other fancy stuff, but we still doesn't have kcontrol? Brr...

(Yes, there is a system settings, and that won't let you configure your printer, for example.)
