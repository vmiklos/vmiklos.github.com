<p>So I got the followings today at the uni on a Windows box:</p><p><pre>
    ping alaplab.</p><p>    Pinging alaplab.mit.bme.hu [152.66.252.18] with 32 bytes of data:</p><p>    Reply from 152.66.252.18: bytes=32 time&lt;1ms TTL=127
    Reply from 152.66.252.18: bytes=32 time&lt;1ms TTL=127

    Reply from 152.66.252.18: bytes=32 time&lt;1ms TTL=127</p><p>    Ping statistics for 152.66.252.18:
        Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
    Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
        Minimum = 0ms, Maximum = 0ms, Average = 0ms
</pre></p><p>Now I wonder if they just ignore the dot at the end of the hostname or WTF.</p>
