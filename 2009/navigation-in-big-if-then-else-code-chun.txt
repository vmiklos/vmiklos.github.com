So when trying to understand others' code, and they use large while/for/if blocks, it's hard to see where one if ends, unless it's on the same page so vim highlights it. I remembered already once that there is a char to jump to the start { of such a block from its end } and vica-versa, but I forgot it, so now I had to look it up again. It's '%'. :-)
