<p>So we had <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3549">this</a> bugreport, just building miro against python 2.6 did not work out very well. Then I pushed a python-2.5 package, before I would realise all the miro deps would have to built against py25 as well, if I want to achieve this approach. OK, that's a no-go. Then I found the right few-liner solution in the #python@freenode logs. :)</p><p>I sent it to upstream, we'll see how will they handle it.</p><p>Oh, and I got a <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/gitweb/?p=darcs-fast-export.git;a=commit;h=66fd4e73c87a85516bb4651c5e90209e2320f706">new patch</a> to darcs-fast-export. A second contributor, yay! :)</p>
