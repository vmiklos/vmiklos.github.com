The next step in the recent link:|filename|/2020/pdfium-sign-verify.adoc[PDFium-based signature
verification story] is my https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/lo_pdfsignatures/[Handling PDF
digital signatures in LibreOffice with PDFium] talk at FOSDEM 2021, in the
https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/track/libreoffice/[LibreOffice devroom]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njoHDY47mnA[pre-recorded video]). The talk gives you an overview of
digital signing in general, all the ODF/OOXML/PDF handling, signing/verification, various other
related past Collabora projects, and then goes into details regarding how PDFium was improved and is
used to do a better PDF signature verification in LibreOffice when opening PDF files in Draw.

The virtual room had
around 150 participants and the Matrix based online conference was well-organized. Speakers even got
a free t-shirt before the event, I appreciated the "bring your own beer" joke :-)

An other benefit of this unusual setup was to avoid the dreaded
https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/01/24/coming-to-fosdem-2020/[room is full] problems, where you
carefully selected a talk to attend and then failed to hear it.

I expect quite some other slides from other Collaborans and the wider community will be available on
http://planet.documentfoundation.org/[Planet], don't miss them.

You can get a snapshot / demo of Collabora Office and try it out yourself right now:
https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-office-latest-snapshot/[try unstable snapshot].  Collabora
intends to continue supporting and contributing to LibreOffice, the code is merged so we expect all
of this work will be available in TDF's next release too (7.2).
