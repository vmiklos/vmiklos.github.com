probably this is known, but i've just figured out how to get rid of grep when i use
<pre>foo |grep ... |sed ...</pre>
the magic command is
<pre>foo |sed -n '/^match/s/foo/bar/p'</pre>

if we're at it, you can even get rid of sed if you use bash and just want to do simple replaces like 1.0 -> 1_0:
<pre>$ pkgver=1.0
$ echo ${pkgver//./_}
1_0_0</pre>

two intereting tricks remained. the first is about deleting from a pattern to an another one (including both line)
<pre>$ echo -e 'a\nb\nc\nd\ne'
a
b
c
d
e
$ echo -e 'a\nb\nc\nd\ne' |sed /b/,/d/d
a
e</pre>

the last one is about deleting to the end of the file from a pattern:
<pre>$ echo -e 'a\nb\nc\nd\ne' |sed '/c/,$d'
a
b</pre>

ok, that's all for today :)
