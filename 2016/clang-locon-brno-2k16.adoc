The last week I gave a
http://conference.libreoffice.org/2016/the-program/sept-9th-friday/[Using
clang-based tools beyond loplugin] lightning talk at LibreOffice conference
2016, on the last day. Click on the image to see all the slides.

If you're a vim or emacs user and you work with $$C++11$$ code, you probably
want to have a look at
http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-rename.html[clang-rename],
http://clang.llvm.org/extra/include-fixer.html[include-fixer] and some editor
plugin exposing the power of libclang (like
https://valloric.github.io/YouCompleteMe/[YouCompleteMe] or
https://github.com/libclang-vim/libclang-vim[libclang-vim]), sometimes these
are really helpful.
