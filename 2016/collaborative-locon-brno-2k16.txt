Yesterday I gave a
http://conference.libreoffice.org/2016/the-program/sept-8th-thursday/[Collaborative
editing using LibreOfficeKit] talk at LibreOffice conference 2016, in the
development track. There were many interested parties -- not a surprise, as
this is the power horse behind LibreOffice Online. :-)
