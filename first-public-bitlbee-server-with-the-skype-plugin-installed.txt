i just recently got a mail about that 'bitlbee1.asnetinc.net' is a public server with my skype plugin installed. in other words, you no longer are forced to run your own bitlbee server if you want to use skype from bitlbee, yay! :)

note: actually if you are behind nat, then this is not something useful for you as the public server will want to connect to your skype instance, actually. :/
