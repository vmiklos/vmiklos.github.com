if you use rsync to copy your git repo (i mean a non-bare repo here: a repo with a working dir + a .git one), <code>git diff</code> will show that you touched your files. using <code>git checkout -f</code> can be a workaround to hide those changes, but then when you rsync again, it'll see that git thouched those files, so it'll re-download all the tracked files. infinite loop. so here is a trick from <a href="http://colabti.de/irclogger/irclogger_log/git?date=2007-09-10,Mon&sel=676#l1067">gitte</a>: using

<code>git update-index --refresh</code>

the index itself will be updated, not the tracked files. this was rsync will only re-download the index which is far less time, compared to the original one :)
