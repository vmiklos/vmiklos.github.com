http://hawthornlandings.org/2013/02/15/how-to-writing-an-excellent-post-event-wrap-up-report/:
- Schedule time to write and publish the report within 48 hours of the event. Block time on your calendar so it happens.
- Along with your text about what you found most useful about the event, include photos and video or audio recordings, preferably embedded in the post. Linking to these resources is also OK.
- Include important stats in your post that are relevant to the community attending the event, e.g. number of attendees, number of student attendees, number of committers, etc.
- Make sure to thank the event organizers and sponsors in an appropriate fashion.
