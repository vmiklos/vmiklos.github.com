this was yesterday, but probably still a news

so in the (not so good) old times we used some up2date.foo scripts to have a common $up2date variable for several FrugalBuilds. these are ugly and are broken in chroot. the "new" trend is to use Finclude for these scripts. yesterday the last up2date.thunderbird-i18n file was removed, so this big merge ended. so far we have already 20 scheme :)

probably the next will be to get rid of the old 'x' dependency in all packages (mostly done already)
