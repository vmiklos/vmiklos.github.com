The story is old, it was exactly 3 years ago when last time I switched
the engine under my blog. That time I switched from my custom php/mysql
blog to b2evolution, and I hoped that using that engine it'll require
less time to manage it. Actually this wasn't true:

- When the php-5.3 upgrade came, I had to manually fix stuff.
- I got a lot of spam, even if the captcha provided by the ready-to-use
  b2evo plugin was enabled.
- The last thing: It turned out that it created the SQL schema in
  latin2, so utf8 comments had problems.

At that point I had enough trouble to think about migrating away from
b2evo. And then I found http://artagnon.com/rejourn[rejourn], which is
quite close to what I think is ideal to me. I just changed it a bit:

- Added asciidoc support next to markdown.
- Added RSS support, as my blog is part of the Frugalware and the
  LibreOffice planet, and I didn't want to lose those readers.
- Added support for tags, so that I can have a feed with a given tag
  only (to avoid OT posts on planets).

Before you ask: yes, I plan to submit back these feature to rejourn, if
Ram accepts them. ;)

And finally, some more benefits:

- the whole blog is now static HTML, generated by a single Makefile (so
  it's faster + the server load is lower)
- I can blog while I'm offline then later just `git push` the result.
- I no longer have to use WYSIWYG editors or write HTML manually, I can
  use asciidoc. :)

*Update:* I forgot to mention:

- I http://vmiklos.hu/file/rejourn-import-b2evo.py[put up] a simple
  b2evo -> rejourn conversion script.
- I just discovered that when I get email about new comments, I can
  reply via email as well - that's really cool! :)
