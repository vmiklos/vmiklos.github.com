i've recently added 2 small flags to the newest (m176) OpenOffice.org development snapshot FrugalBuild resulting significant building speedup. in numbers, the build time with 4 languages is 591 mins currently, while before it was 680 minutes (13 percent difference). basically the 2 tricks:
<ul>
  <li>--disable-qadevooo: don't build automated testing tools, we don't need them and the build takes a hell of time</li>
  <li>--enable-gcjaot: the java tools used during the build are now native binaries (compiled using gcj)</li>
</ul>
