So I have been invited to this year's openSUSE conference in Nurnberg to
give a short presentation about my GSoC work (the RTF export rewrite in
LibreOffice).

As I expected, the really interesting part was to meet people I never
had the ability to meet in person previously - and of course to learn
other new stuff. :)

So some of the items I really liked:

* We actually did some hacking, see
  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/writer/commit/?id=a8e76355d980ee015162023150ae48d68fbb4124[here]
  (thanks Cedric for pointing out the issue for me).
* I learned about
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs#C[trigraphs] - thanks Fridrich!
* I now heard about flat ODF from Muthusuba.
* Nice jokes by Tor about old UNIX systems where the default installation added a login for Kernighan and Ritchie by default. :)
* Met great people from the LibreOffice team (Kohei, Noel, Muthu, Cedric, Tor, Fridrich, Petr, Lubos), and outside: Stephan Kulow (coolo, the ex-kde-master) and others.

To sum up: thank you for the invitation, I enjoyed it! :)
