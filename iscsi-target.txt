Today I packaged http://frugalware.org/packages/103291[tgt] an iSCSI
target (server). The upstream package provides a large number of
examples, though I thought it's a good idea to note what I used for
testing:

----
# egrep -v '#|^$' /etc/tgt/targets.conf 
default-driver iscsi
<target iqn.2010-11.local.test:storage>
    backing-store /dev/sdb
</target>

Something offtopic: a
https://github.com/artagnon/rejourn/commit/3b87aab385647ea8e5dd8844aec913ab3c02252f[rejourn]
patch accepted and a
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31362[LibreOffice] bug
fixed today.
