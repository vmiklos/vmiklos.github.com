This was almost two days ago, but... So I got the next problem report from OS, where he attached a sample document which had a table at the beginning. The document text was exported but no the table structure. (So if you had at least one line of text before the table, the bug was not there, that's how I did not notice it.) The <a href="http://hg.services.openoffice.org/cws/vmiklos01/rev/d6b973424417">one-liner</a> fix is now in the CWS and it's <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/ooo-build/ooo-build/commit/?id=eb004f62b0a4507b9cb9a6b66a0721e46d0baefb">backported</a> to ooo-build master as usual.
