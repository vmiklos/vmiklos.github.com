<p>git filter-branch is a new command in git-1.5.3 and today i met a situation where it was really useful. here is the scenario:</p><p>i have a 'vmexam' (like soxexam, "vmiklos' examples") repo, random small code chunks, every commit touches only a given subdir. after some time some projects need an own repo and i do versioned releases. this was the case with <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/project/pyrssi/">pyrssi</a>, too</p><p>so i wanted to have a new repo with only the pyrssi-related commits and without anything else. this is exactly the case git filter-branch's subdirectory filter is for:</p><p><code>git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter python/cgi/pyrssi HEAD</code></p><p>then in the old repo i just rm -rf'd the code and i had it in the root dir of the new repo. yay! :)</p>
