<p>okay, i learned something today :)</p><p>you have a client behind a firewall and you have a server somewhere. and you want to ssh from the server to the client. that's exactly why ssh has a magic -R option!</p><p>if you do an</p><p><code>$ ssh -R 19022:localhost:22 server</code></p><p>that will mean that you can ssh to client:22 on the server by sshing to localhost:19022 on the server. yes, and it works even if the client is behind a firewall, yay! :)</p><p>update:</p><p>you probably want to add this to your ~/.ssh/config on the server as well:</p><p><pre>
Host client
        NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes
        HostName localhost
        Port 19022
</pre></p><p>so that you can easily just type</p><p><code>$ ssh client</code></p><p>on the server</p>
