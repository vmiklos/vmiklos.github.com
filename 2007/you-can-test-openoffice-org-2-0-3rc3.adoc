<p>after a long time, openoffice now builds again out of the box without any patches as all our fixes are in ooo-build :)</p><p>also, i recently started to re-use my "bmf" repo for packaging pre/rc versions, so it was logical to get rid of the "ooodev" repo and merge it to bmf. so openoffice.org-2.3oog680_m5-1 (alias 2.3.0rc3) is available for my bmf repo for both i686 and x86_64. compared to 2.2.x, the two notable improvements (imho) are the working mozilla plugin and the ooxml support.</p><p>thanks boobaa for building it for i686! :)</p>
