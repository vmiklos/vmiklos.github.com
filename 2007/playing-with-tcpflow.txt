<p>tcpflow is a nice small console application to debug your network data. the usage is simple. just something like</p><p><code># tcpflow -i eth0</code></p><p>is enough. you're recommended to start it in an empty directory :)</p><p>don't be surprised, the incoming and the outgoing connection to a server's given port will be logged to 2 different files ;)</p>
