<p>it was a while ago when we registered at <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6659?p=Frugalware+Linux">ohloh.net</a>, but i recently re-visited that page, and i found some nice PR texts there ;)</p><p><blockquote> Over the past twelve months, 18 developers contributed new code to Frugalware Linux.</p><p>This is a relatively large team, putting this project among the top 10% of all project teams on Ohloh.</p><p>For this measurement, Ohloh considered only recent changes to the code. Over the entire history of the project, 36 developers have contributed. </blockquote>
(<a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/6659/factoids/273910">source</a>)</p><p>well, i always considered our team as a nice and good but small team, it turns out that if you count projects, we're not that small! :)</p><p>it also creates nice charts about what programming languages do we use, etc, etc. so it's a different approach, compared to cia, but it's interesting.</p>
