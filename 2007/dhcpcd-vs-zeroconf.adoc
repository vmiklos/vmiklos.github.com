<p>maybe you know a situation that is regular for me: when testing a new wireless network - if dhcp is misconfigured, dhcpcd would just have to timeout. though - thanks to zeroconf support - it uses to pick up some ip addresses instead, making debugging hard. so here is a trick to disable zeroconf support (so that dhcpcd will just timeout):</p><p>append</p><p><code>dhcp_opts = -L</code></p><p>to your /etc/sysconfig/network/default (or other) profile for the section of the wireless interface</p>
