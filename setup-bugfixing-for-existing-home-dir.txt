So we had <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3339">this bug</a> for a while, and the <a href="http://frugalware.org/pipermail/frugalware-git/2009-March/028117.html">solution</a> was just using an other dir, so the user later can merge the contents of the two dirs.

Sigh, testing the setup still takes a lot of time. For example to test the above bug, you need to do a base install, which still takes a lot of time. Hopefully sooner or later we can switch to kvm (as the old kvm-incompatible hw gets unused) and then this can be faster.
