title: QtSql vs. SQLite

The problem was the following: I had http://pastebin.com/Gh66XZxw[this]
example code and the `size()` method just gave me insane result all the
time, while just changing the driver to `QMYSQL` made the code work
properly. After asking on `#qt`, I have been
http://pastebin.com/1HExkgiw[pointed out] that the SQLite backend of
QtSql does not support the `size()` method. :/

So - for now - I'll just use MySql for my unit tests, even if that means
I have to manually truncate the contents of each table. Worths checking
a bit later again, though - since I already used in-memory SQLite for my
unit tests when I had a project in PHP with Doctrine, and it was working
just fine.
