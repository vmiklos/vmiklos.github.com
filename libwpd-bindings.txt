I tried to search back when did I create Java bindings for libwpd - it
seems
http://vmiklos.hu/gitweb/?p=libwpd-old.git;a=commit;h=2ee19c1e5e3b5cc28db8c9dc9aa7e6116e62b730[this]
was the first commit.

First I kept back the source code to get some money for it (there were a
customer who seemed to be willing to pay, but then disappeared), then I
just abandoned the idea and pushed it to
http://libwpd.sourceforge.net/[SourceForge.net] to some
http://libwpd.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/libwpd/libwpd2-bindings/[CVS
repo], (I even mentioned it in a
link:/blog/preparing-frugalware-1-0pre2[blog post]), which is finally
now converted to
http://libwpd.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libwpd/libwpd-bindings;a=summary[git].

Long story short, a week ago finally Fridrich
http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwpd/files/libwpd-bindings/download[released]
the first version of the code, after about 2.75 years. :)
