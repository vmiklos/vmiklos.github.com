Okay, this is a crazy idea, but I love asciidoc. So the pipeline is the following: asciidoc -&gt; docbook -&gt; latex -&gt; pdf -&gt; odp -&gt; ppt.

The fun part is that docbook is XML and then later I convert the stuff back to XML again (odp), but that's necessary as latex adds the nice themes and layout to the text.

Also the method is semi-automated as I generate latex from asciidoc, then copy&amp;paste it to a latex-beamer document with some manual fixup, then I can convert the rest in a more or less automated way. Time to package odfpy and other affected, but not yet packaged components. ;-)
