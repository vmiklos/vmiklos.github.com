I spent some time with figuring out how to include <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/piechart/test.pdf">piecharts</a> and <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/graphviz/test.pdf">graphs</a> in presentations.

The nice fact is that both metapost and graphviz output eps, so the result is totally scalable. ;)
