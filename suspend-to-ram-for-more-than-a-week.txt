So I went offline for skiing for about 11 days (Jan 30 06:24:13-Feb 10 00:48:09 to be exact), and I forgot that suspend to RAM works only for a few days. My normal notebook of course switched off. But interesting enough, the iBook still did not switch off, it said the battery even had 5%! :)

Yeah, I still love this HW.
