There is now a <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/project/darcs-fast-export/t/testimport-git-twoway.sh">testcase</a> that checks if the feature mentioned in the post title works.

Basically I hope I can write - based on this - a git-darcs wrapper that will make it easy to convert a darcs repo to a git one, work in git, then push the result back to the darcs repo, something I wish a long time ago. ;-)
