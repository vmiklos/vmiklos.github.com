Finally python 3.0 (or python3k) arrived to -current. Of course the external modules are still for 2.6, but that's not something we want to change before 1.0

OTOH, they screwed up something at the uni, the dhcp servers were not functional on the wireless network, so I had time to read my current book, and did not read email till 22h. :-)
