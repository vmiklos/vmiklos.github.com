This is useful if you really want to record the audio of a clip, which is not on youtube (you can use youtube-dl there).

The <a href="http://carthick.wordpress.com/2007/11/26/linux-recording-soundcard-output-using-arecord/">howto</a> explains pretty much everything.

Here are the amixer parameters I needed:

amixer cset numid=24,iface=MIXER,name='Capture Source' 5

~/.asoundrc:

pcm.copy {
type plug
slave {
pcm hw
}
route_policy copy
}

record commandline:

arecord -f cd -t wav -D copy foo.wav
