finally the new netconfig is ready. this is a complete rewrite in C - incuding profiling support, unlimited number of network cards, support for interface names != ethn, multiple ips on a single interface and much more. ah and now the config tool has a manpage: just type<pre>man netconfig</pre> after the usual -Syu. huch, it was about 3 days of work :)
