after a few days of work (and headache) we (me and janny) put togother a java-enabled version of the openoffice.org package. we built the development milestone (m163) of OOo, so it won't hit -current till 2.0.3 is released. ideally this should re-enable features like help and others which were missing since 2.0.0. at the moment the x86_64 packages <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/frugalware-x86_64/">are available</a>, but janny will upload i686 ones soon, too
