in the last two days i was working on creating an initial testsuite for the source tree. what does works:<ul>
  <li>cleaning outdated fpms</li>
  <li>cleaning outdated sources</li>
</ul>
this is the harder part imho
what is planned:
<ul>
  <li>list missing fpms (maybe not needed? checkpkgs does the same)</li>
  <li>download all missing sources</li>
  <li>check for syntax errors</li>
  <li>check for required directives</li>
</ul>
