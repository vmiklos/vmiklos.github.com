<pre>Jan 31 01:16:33 genesis syncpkgd : PWD=/home/syncpkgd ; COMMAND=cp \
/tmp/tmp.HKjbWP /home/ftp/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/frugalware-x86_64/smb4k-0.6.5-1-x86_64.fpm</pre>
the first package built by syncpkgd, the automatic package building daemon

we'll see how much effective it is, the expected performance is that if we push an i686 package, then (if possible) the x86_64 one are uploaded automatically within 4-5 hours :)
