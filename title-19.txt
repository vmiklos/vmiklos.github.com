finally i've got enough time to implement using fakeroot when building in chroot. a simple example about why this is good for us:
select a pkg and put the <pre>touch /etc</pre> command to the end of build(). in chroot, this will run without any warning, and your chroot will be messed up. with the current fakeroot method:
<pre>touch: cannot touch `/etc/foo': Permission denied
==> ERROR: Build Failed.  Aborting...</pre>

yes, that's what we wanted! :)
