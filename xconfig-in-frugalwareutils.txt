a complete rewrite of the old xconfig script in the frugalware pkg is now included in frugalwareutils. since the code is native, it's much more faster. it should work at least as well as the old script, but who knows - if you find any bug then please report it to <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/">us</a>

thanks!
