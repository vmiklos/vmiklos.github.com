krix and janny are doing a great job and so the openoffice.org-2.0 package will hit -current soon. one of the main problems was that (primarily for speed and for being able not to use commercial softwares) we build ooo without java support which means currently that one can't save as .sxw or .odt (.doc works fine :P) it <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=130220">turned out</a> that it's a known bug and now we have a workaround for it. after some time martink@#go-oo@freenode <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/nonav/issues/showattachment.cgi/30826/nojava-fix.diff">prepared</a> a fix. the gentoo m8r suka just started a test build with it, if it will work, we can replace our current workaround with that proper fix
