here is the problem:

you hava gpg key since 5 years. you had various mail addresses over the time and every mail address is attached to a key. so it'll look ugly, like <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/pics/shots/gpg-bloated.png">this</a>.

the problem is that once you pushed a uid (read: email address, attached to a key) to the keyserver, you can no longer remove it. but here is the solution: you can revoke it! :)

how to do so?

it's easy:

<code>$ gpg --edit-key john@foo.org</code>

a list of your ids with numbers are displayed. select a uid:

<code>Command> uid 2</code>

then you can revoke it:

<code>Command> revuid 3
Really revoke this user ID? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  4 = User ID is no longer valid
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 4 here)
Your decision? 4
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
>
Reason for revocation: User ID is no longer valid
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) y</code>

you can notice that the uid is now listed as "revoked" instead of "ultimate"

now you can exit using:

<code>Command> save</code>

and send it to the key server:

<code>$ gpg --send-key 03915096</code>

of course the uids will be still there, but that bloated list should be now short and tiny :)
