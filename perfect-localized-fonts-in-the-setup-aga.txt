We had this problem recently that on the console the fonts were not entirely correct, for example lat2-16.psfu.gz was replaced by lat2a-16.psfu.gz. I finally found why it was still broken in the setup: I forgot to update the Makefile to include the new font in the initrd. ;-)

Now the fonts are perfect again.
