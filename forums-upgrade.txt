finally i got some time to upgrade our forums.frugalware.org to the latest 2.7.6 version. the upgrade went fairly simple, there is an upgrade script that managed the upgrade, then a db integrity check was needed (in fact that repaired/updated the db imho) and finally the small fonts in thm/default/tmpl/forum.css.tmpl has been increased a bit. hopefully everything still works :)
