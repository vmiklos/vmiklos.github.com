i've just set up bogofilter with mutt, it was sooo easy! :)

first you should collect some spam and ham (non-spam) to separate (Maildir) folders

then bogofilter -s -B ~/Maildir/spam/, bogofilter -n -B ~/Maildir/ham. the basic learning is done

to your procmailrc:
<code>
:0fw
| /usr/bin/bogofilter -uep
:0:
* ^X-Bogosity: Spam
.Spam/
</code>

finally i've added a macro to my muttrc to be able to simply tell bogofilter it missed something (haven't noticed a spam):
<code>
macro index S "<pipe-entry>bogofilter -Ns"
</code>
(you can add a similar macro for "bogofilter -Sn" - "hey, this is not a spam" - if you want)

that's all :)
