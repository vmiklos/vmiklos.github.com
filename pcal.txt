I wanted to create some calendar present for Christmas in the family
with pictures and Hungarian year / month order, national holidays, etc.

After looking at a few solutions,
http://pcal.sourceforge.net/pcal-help.html[pcal] seemed to be the best
choice.

There are 3 key points here:

- The order of the year / month can be changed only in build-time. If
  your locale has "year month" and not "month year" order, then you need
  http://vmiklos.hu/file/pcal/order.patch[this patch].
- You need some config for each locale,
  http://vmiklos.hu/file/pcal/calendar_hu.txt[here is mine], containing
  the Hungarian national holidays.
- Finally you need a script
  http://vmiklos.hu/file/pcal/build-from-scratch.sh[like this] to put in
  the pictures.

The result is http://vmiklos.hu/file/pcal/rotated.pdf[here], as you
can see it's fully localized, free software, contains my custom images
and support custom marks for days using a quite flexible syntax.

(Let me know if you know some other project where you can set the
year/month order build-time and the result can be still generated from a
script, ie. it's not some LibreOffice or similar template. ;) )
