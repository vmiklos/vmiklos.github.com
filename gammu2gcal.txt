<a href="http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/bash/gammu2gcal">Here</a> it is.

A simple script to first convert your phone's calendar entries to the ICS format, then to synchronize it with Google Calendar.

The first part is pretty trivial, the second isn't. The main problem is that <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-issues/issues/detail?id=212">there is no standard API</a> for doing so. At the end I ended up using the web UI from curl, which is pretty hackish, but at least works. :)

Update: there is a new version <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/repos/vmexam/bash/gcalsync">here</a>. I moved all cookie/form stuff to the curl config, so probably it'll be usable after 2 days as well... :P
