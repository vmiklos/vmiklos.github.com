I just started searching for an alternate serial driver for Erlang as the semi-official one has zero documentation, and found what?

There is a gen_serial module by spearce, we know each other since last year's GSoC. ;)

Sadly the driver seem to be Windows-only so it's not that interesting, but the world is small.
