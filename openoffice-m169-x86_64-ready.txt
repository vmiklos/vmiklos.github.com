hi

the newest development snapshots's fpms are ready, you can reach at <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/frugalware-x86_64/">you-know-where</a>. no big changes, 4 new languages, more patches submitted to upstream (we now only use only a gcc-4.1.0 specific one) and so on
++++
