We have these WIP repos (stands for Work In Progress), but uploading packages there was always a manual task. This is quite unhandy when the WIP repo is being worked on for multiple months.

We already had some minimal support for WIP repos in the sync client, but it was not enough, the pacman/repoman configs were no propagated from the server to the build nodes.

I recently got some time to work on this and now it's there - once all the build nodes will be upgraded to 1.0, we will be able to use this feature without any limits. :)
