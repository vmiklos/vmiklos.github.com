<a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/809">#809</a> was a request for this. the <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current-iso/frugalware-20060606-i686-net.iso">new snapshot</a> supports using a wireless card to fetch packages. the most common problem (probably) will be that extra modules are not included in the netinstall iso. if a module is requested then we'll put it in. so, please <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/">request</a> the modules you find to be missing! thanks
