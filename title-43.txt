it seems that finally we figured out what causes the following weird problem on some mirrors:<pre>io timeout after 300 seconds -- exiting
rsync error: timeout in data send/receive (code 30) at io.c(181)</pre>
reading again man 5 rsyncd.conf: <pre>timeout
(...)
A good choice for anonymous rsync daemons
may be 600 (giving a 10 minute timeout).</pre>
and yes, adding "timeout = 600" to the relevant module solved the problems :)
