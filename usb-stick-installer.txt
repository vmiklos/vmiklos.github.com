there was a request for a long time to support installing from an usb stick, now it seems i've had time to implement this feature

you need <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-0.5-iso/frugalware-0.5-i686-usb.tar.gz">this</a> tarball, then you can unpack it and run ./usb_install.sh as root

if you hit a bug, then report it to <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/">us</a>, as usual ;)
