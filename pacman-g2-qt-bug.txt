BMH still feeds me with info, he just found a -Qt bug - fortunately the fix was rather trivial.

The nontrivial stuff is that he wants callbacks in the Python bindings and it seems that won't be easy. The reason is that - it seems, I don't have a working implementation yet - we'll need the traditional 'void *data' extra parameters in each callback to support that, since we need to store the Python context pointer somewhere.

Of course first I want to have the whole thing working, before breaking the API with no good reason.

The whole idea is based on <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Automatically-generated-callbacks-using-directors-(python)-td19239301.html">this</a> post. The provided examples work fine, at least.

Snip. Dscho mailed me today with a project list about what could I do in Git - the two items are a major merge-recursive rework, the other is about packv4. I could learn a lot with both, my interest is in this order. But that's not yet in coding status, we're just discussing the details ATM.
