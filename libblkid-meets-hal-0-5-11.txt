So upstream recently released hal 0.5.12 and it's maintained by crazy who seem to be a bit busy currently, and I don't really wanted to bump his pkg (actually I tried and I failed), but I bumped our udev pkg yesterday so we no longer has libvolume_id. So I <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/source/apps/hal/move-from-libvolume_id-to-libblkid.patch">backported</a> the relevant patch from git and it seems to work. ;)

(Actually the header is informative, but fake as I created the patch from scratch, based on the one which was in git.)
