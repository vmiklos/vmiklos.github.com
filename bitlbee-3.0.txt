Even if I gave it a quick testing about two weeks ago, now I tried the
new Twitter / identi.ca support and I like it a lot. Now messages are
not coming from a single user by default, but a separate channel is
created, nicks are appearing there, and I can just highlight people to
reply to their last tweet or simply type to submit a new one.

And of course my Skype module still works, as Wilmer fixed it up. :)
