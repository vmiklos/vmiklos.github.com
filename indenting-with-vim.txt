probably you already faced with the following problem: if you past a shellscript to vim, then it's indented, so the last line of the script will have tons of whitespaces at the start of the line. there are two problems here:
<ol>
  <li>how to disable indenting temporarily? use :paste and :nopaste</li>
  <li>how to indent the text after the paste? mark the lines you want to indent in visual mode (use V) then == will indent them :)</li>
</ol>
