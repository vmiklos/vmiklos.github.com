i always forgot how to grant full access to a db for a normal user in mysql and have to rtfm from time to time. so i post here the magic command, hopefully it'll be a bit easier to search in the blog archive than rtfm'ing :)
<pre>GRANT ALL privileges on dbname.* TO 'username'@'localhost'
IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';</pre>
