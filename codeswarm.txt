The <a href="http://github.com/felipec/codeswarm.rb/tree">project</a> was linked on a news site today, but <a href="http://frugalware.org/~voroskoi/">voroskoi</a> already poked me about "hey, you should try it out with Frugalware", so I was aware of the project already. The reason I point it out is that now they create a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxjLbj8oT1k">sample</a> for Git as well, and I seem to appear in it at 4m25s, heh.
