i always forgot how to grant full access to a db for a normal user in
mysql and have to rtfm from time to time. so i post here the magic
command, hopefully it'll be a bit easier to search in the blog archive
than rtfm'ing :)

----
GRANT ALL privileges on dbname.* TO 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secret';
