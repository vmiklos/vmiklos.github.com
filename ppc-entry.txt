I recently ported our Qemu package to PPC, and just tested that it really works. We have a Linux binary (compiled for i386) for some 'plan making' exercise (inside the AI course at the uni), and of course I wanted to run it on my iBook. And yes, just wrapping the command with qemu-i386 made it work! :)

The other problem I noticed is that building external modules on PPC does not work. It seem to be a <a href="http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11143">known bug</a>. PLD has a patch that changes the error message - to a permission problem. Given that on x86 building a kernel module is possible as a user - the goal would be the same on PPC as well. Not yet resolved...
