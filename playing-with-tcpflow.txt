tcpflow is a nice small console application to debug your network data. the usage is simple. just something like

<code># tcpflow -i eth0</code>

is enough. you're recommended to start it in an empty directory :)

don't be surprised, the incoming and the outgoing connection to a server's given port will be logged to 2 different files ;)
