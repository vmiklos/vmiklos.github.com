I gave kernel-mode setting a try today with xorg-server 1.6.1, xf86-video-intel 2.8.1 and kernel 2.6.31.

From the NEWS file:

<blockquote>
The driver certainly will work best with an i915 module from a recent kernel (2.6.31) and with kernel-modesetting (KMS, specified by loading i915 with the option "modeset=1").
</blockquote>

<a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/pics/bug/kms.png">Here</a> is the result I got.

Given that the Fedora people enabled KMS in 2.6.28, and now the kernel guys say that it's really fine in 2.6.31, I should probably give it a try next time around 2.6.34. ;)
