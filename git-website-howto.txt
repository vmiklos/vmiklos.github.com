There was a howto about how to host website with git - the basic problem is that the working dir is not updated automatically on push. <a href="http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto">This howto</a> gives a step-by-step solution for this problem. Of course I know the solution (and it's problems) for a long time, but it's always nice when someone with a good writing taste puts it out as a documentation.

To make the long story short, I noticed a correctness with the howto and mailed the author, then completely forgot about it. Now someone linked it on #git, and I was wondering if this is the same webpage howto I read or something different. This ended up with noticing my name on the page, giving me a thank for noticing. ;-)
