<p>So a friend of mine showed that he has an offline map on his non-smart phone. A googled for mgmaps and figured out how to use it as well, but it wasn't really trivial, so I'm collecting some links here.</p><p>First, you need the mgmaps midlet itself. I read that the KML support (ie importing favorites) has been improved in the development version, so I tried that one.</p><p>Given that you must have a signed jar (or otherwise you'll get a question each time you scroll the map), I just went to <a href="http://wap.mgmaps.com/">this page</a> and downloaded the signed devel midlet from there.</p><p>The second one was to download the maps I'm interested in, without using the expensive GPRS connection.</p><p>First I generated the .map file, using <a href="http://www.mapcacher.com/">this page</a>. It's really just about generating a descriptor file which contains the coordinates, wished zoom level and map type.</p><p>The second step is to actually download the maps based on the descriptor file. I haven't played too much with this, the .net <a href="http://www.mgmaps.com/cache/">gmapmaker</a> app did the job fine. Yes, a cmdline, opensource app would be better, but I don't really care.</p><p>Now if I have a GPS coordinate, I can search for it off-line on my map, as long as it's in Hungary. :) (And the whole map is about 300MB, as I have the map for Budapest with an extra zoom level.)</p><p>The third part is about transfering the google maps directions feature to the phone: ie getting the directions on google maps, saving it to a kml file, and using it off-line (for free) on the phone.</p><p>This is partly implemented. See <a href="http://forum.mgmaps.com/viewtopic.php?p=12473">this thread</a> on how to save the KML file. There is no nice blue line ATM for the directions (but they are <a href="http://forum.mgmaps.com/viewtopic.php?p=14330">working on it</a>), but apart from that, you have everything.</p><p>And yes, this is completely free (if you count the .net app, then only as in beer). :)</p>

<p>So it's interesting that firefox 3.5 now requires one more click if you want to accept a self-signed cert. I think it's now at 4. And this means that a non-addict user basically won't be able to access those sites, it's already way more complex than what is acceptable for an avarage user.</p><p>An other interesting aspects is version control. With SVN, you did only 'svn diff, svn up' and if both were a no-op, then you knew that you can start to work. With darcs, one more command was necessary due to local commits: 'dr what, dr pull, dr push'. And now with git (if you use local branches): 'git diff, git branch, git push, git pull'. (I admit that this second example can be simplified with a shell script, but still. ;) )</p>

<p>I recently made a mistake and instead of just erasing the bootloader from the MBR of a notebook, I erased the full MBR. Of course I made a backup before writing to MBR - but I made it to the second partiton of the disk...</p><p>So I tried the parted and the gpart heuristics, but actually none of them gave usable results. Then I just dd'ed with netcat the whole hdd to my machine, used GetDataBack with wine, that found the relevant file, copied the mbr to a pendrive, plugged in to the notebook and dd'ed it back to the hdd.</p><p>After a reboot, everything was back. Sadly I didn't really had time in the last one and a half day to do this, except last night. So I had frustrating 36 hours, as I wasn't entirely sure if this was possible to do or not.</p><p>Life is good. :)</p>

Looks like I manged to hit a bug in <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.bash.bugs/13258">bash itself</a>. It was triggered by repoman, let's see how upstream will handle it.

<p>I'm just talking about 1.5+, since before that version it's like there would be not git merge, just git cherry-pick. (You had to explicitly specify each revision. That's not merging.)</p><p>A quick howto is <a href="http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=92">here</a>.</p><p>A command which may be useful but left out is like 'git log master..branch', to see what revisions will be merged:</p><p><pre>
$ time svn mergeinfo <a href="https://swig.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swig/trunk/">https://swig.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/swig/trunk/</a> \
--show-revs eligible

user    0m0.155s
sys     0m0.013s

So when trying to understand others' code, and they use large while/for/if blocks, it's hard to see where one if ends, unless it's on the same page so vim highlights it. I remembered already once that there is a char to jump to the start { of such a block from its end } and vica-versa, but I forgot it, so now I had to look it up again. It's '%'. :-)

<p>So my problem was that I already set up PGP, and I use it for sending / receiving signed (and sometimes crypted) messages. Today I received an S/MIME signed message and I had to verify it.</p><p>First mutt just bailed out with "Can't verify S/MIME signature", but that was because S/MIME was not configured. Here is what I did:</p><p><pre>
cd ~/.mutt
cp /usr/share/doc/mutt-ng/samples/smime.rc .
# edit muttrc to source it
</pre></p><p>I thought that will be enough, but that was too aggressive.</p><p>First, it disabled my PGP support. I had to put 'unset smime_is_default' to the top of smime.rc.</p><p>Second, it tried to verify the whole damn cert chain, which is simply something I can't really care, as the cert is a self-signed cert anyway. To do this, I had to uncomment the last two lines in smime.rc (set smime_verify_command/smime_verify_opaque_command).</p><p>So far it works just like I wanted it! :)</p>
