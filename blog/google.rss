            <title>Google account migration</title>
            <description>&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole story starts
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=182075"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
The whole conflict is about I had a google account with my vmiklos.hu
domain already, but now the google apps account took it over and they
asked me to rename the old account to something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I joined the early adopter program and I was happy about it, finally I
could access Picasa with my google apps account, though I could not make
it to picasa.vmiklos.hu or something. But at least I could use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;#8217;m writing is that now they changed something regarding google
groups as well, since I just noticed I can no longer post to the
invite-only lists hosted on google groups where I use my personal
address&amp;#8230; It turns out the trick is to get the old (renamed) address
unsubscribed and get the new one subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not really claiming, since the new state is much more clear, but
this unsubscribe + subscribe dance is rather uncomfortable&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="paragraph"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a related
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=60227"&gt;doc
link&lt;/a&gt; in case you want to use gtalk on your domain as well (for now I
decided not to use it).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
