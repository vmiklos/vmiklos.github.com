<p>There was a recent interview with the developers of UHU-Linux, which was the de-facto "Hungarian Linux" a few years ago here at Hungary.</p><p>The guys had a pretty closed approach and finally it seems they make money from products based on their distro - releasing something useful for the users for free is definitely not the number one task on their todo.</p><p>There were a couple of comments to the article, a few of them was about Frugalware, given that we are still the only distro where the origin is Hunagary and it's actively used outside Hungary as well.</p><p>In fact I just did a quick search, listing the last commit dates of each devel. Two of the Hungarian ones are pretty inactive. Both of them do other administrative tasks. (Buildserver / bugtracker hosting, etc.) But the rest is quite active, which was a surprise. I had the impression that lately we got some new French devels and once they got their git accounts, they got a bit less-motivated but this is simply not true. All of them (and this is true for the other non-Hungarian devels as well) was more or less active in the last month.</p><p>I think this is pretty straight-forward, even if the ohloh stat says the commit number (compared to last year) is sightly decreasing. This is a typical example: the commit number is not everything. I think this time last year we might be a bit more active overally, but that was because several devels (including me) spent a horrible amount of their free times on Frugalware, which is not something you can do for several years. Today we have a much stable devel base, increasing package maintainer community and yes, I'm happy with our current status. :)</p>

<p>I already <a href="/blog/preparing-frugalware-1-0pre2">wrote once</a> about Pootle forcing us to use UTF-8 and not respecting the po headers (where charset can be set), but there is a new chapter in this story. So in case the charset is wrong, the generated mo file is still fine, as long as you have utf8 support in your system. Of course in the setup, where we have an "as much as possible" stripped down system, this is not true.</p><p>A contributor reported this recently, and the symptom was that "sometimes" netconfig is localized, sometimes not. It turned out a bit later that it's localized when it's running in the target system's chroot (when the install of the packages is finished and the config tools are invoked), but not before the installation. Of course the previous solution worked here pretty fine as well: I just had to convert the remaining translations to utf8 manually, and then add code to convert from utf8 to the native encoding in the pre-package stage (currently named 'make prepare') of frugalwareutils.</p><p>Hand converting is boring. And sometimes it's completely messed up, for example you need an 'iconv -f utf8 -t latin1' twice to get the correct accents. ;-)</p>

<p>We had this old #3331 bug, and it turns out that Fedora had an s390 patch that fixed it. Of course the patch name is misleading since it fixed something on x86 as well, so it was the last thing I thought to try... :-)</p><p>I got a reply reply to my libbtctl patch I sent back in last year:</p><p><blockquote>

<p>So we <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3628">got a bugreport</a> - it seems the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/earth/thread?tid=0d0f5abd12716b7e&amp;hl=en">solution</a> is just about getting rid of the bundled libcrypto, as it's incopatible with the not-bundled libssl.</p><p>Ported erlang and postfix to ppc, the later because I wanted to use git-send-email, and I like to config postfix once, then point all the apps at postfix and then I have to change my pass only at once place when I do so.</p><p>I got an i586 machine yesterday with the "please install Linux on it for me" slogan. Sadly we at Frugalware do not support i586. First I wanted to install Slackware, but it turned out that the machine does not read DVDs and I did not wanted to download all the CDs of Slack and it turns out that Slack has no netinstall I ended up installing Fedora. Well, I tried to. The HDD is only 1.2G, and they wanted X on it, so disabled almost everything, except X and blackbox. ;)</p><p>But honestly it just does not worth the time, people should just bin such a machine and get a life. :P</p>

<p>So there is <a href="http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/">such a project</a>, and my relevant ~/.mailcap entry is:</p><p><pre>
$ grep docx ~/.mailcap
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document; docx2txt.pl %s -|iconv -c -f utf8 -t latin2; copiousoutput;
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.documen; docx2txt.pl %s - |iconv -c -f utf8 -t latin2; copiousoutput;
</pre></p><p>I don't exactly know why the later is needed. I haven't checked the RFC. The fact is that sqmail sends the content-type header using format=flowed (no indication about using this format, it just uses it), and mutt doesn't like it. So it's an sqmail or mutt bug. But the workaround is the second entry above.</p><p>BTW I started to learn Erlang yesterday, there is a good "Programming Erlang" book, it's more than 500 pages, I managed to read the first ~50 pages.</p><p>OTOH Fruglware 1.0rc1 is out. Laying in the bed and releasing from my iBook is fun. :)</p>

<p>Usually there are 1-2 nasty bugs in each release - after all that's the only eason I push for having at least a pre-release every 2 months.</p><p>So today's one was a nasty double free bug in xconfig, so after the install there were no xorg.conf. The fix is now in git, so it should be over, but I was a bit disappointed, as so far Priyank's file descriptor / memory leak fixes were all carefully tested, however this one was obviously bogus, so probably it was not tested at all. OK, hopefully such stuff won't really happen again.</p><p>Snip. In VIM, I wanted to do a "Pj" 1000 times. 1000Pj will do "1000P and [one] j", so that's not the right way. <a href="mailto:qaPjq1000@a">qaPjq1000@a</a> will do it: qafooq records foo to the "a" macro, then <a href="mailto:1000@a">1000@a</a> calls it 1000 times.
