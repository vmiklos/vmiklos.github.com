<div class="paragraph"><p>Even though I spend little of my free time with sysadmin stuff these days, this
came up recently. A few years ago I hit an issue about <code>mdadm</code> creating too new
metadata that wasn&#8217;t handled by the installed kernel, so I remembered to use
<code>--metadata 0.90</code> when creating a new array. Additionally, I preferred using
<code>cfdisk</code> for partitioning.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It turns out this caused quite some grief when it came to <code>grub2</code>, I wrote about
this <a href="/blog/grub2">earlier</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that was about the theory, in a VM. This is
about the practice. In practice, <code>gparted</code> turned out to be too risky, and I
choose the following approach to repartition the hard drives (so there is
enough space for <code>grub2</code>) and upgrade the <code>mdadm</code> metadata.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>First, I broke the mirror by removing one leg of the RAID1 array:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>mdadm --manage /dev/md126 --fail /dev/sdd1
mdadm --manage /dev/md126 --remove /dev/sdd1</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then I created a new array (with a single leg) with the new metadata and formatted it:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>fdisk /dev/sdd
mdadm --create /dev/md125 --metadata=1.0 --level=1 --assume-clean --raid-devices=2 missing /dev/sdd1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md125</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally I copied over the live system:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>mkdir /mnt/md125
mount /dev/md125 /mnt/md125
rsync --delete -avxP / /mnt/md125
umount /mnt/md125</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The rest was easy: I booted a livecd to do the <code>rsync</code> once again (taking a few
minutes only), and once the system was running from the new array, added the
leg of the old array to the new one as well&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and that&#8217;s it.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I think the first attempt to track LibreOffice RTF Writer regressions (bugs not
presenting in some earlier versions) was in
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/27680">this</a>
mail. That started with 14 bugs, and of course while I fixed a few, new ones
were added as well. I guess this is mostly due to testing work, since new fixes
are usually covered by unit tests, so re-introducing the same problems
nowadays is a bit more work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I remember I was down to one regression a few months ago, but we still had
performance problems, which
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=a48e2fd9049797110b3b2505c363557284987ca8">got
solved</a> a few weeks ago, so I had the idea that I want to go down to zero
during the holidays. It seems today I finally managed to do so&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;bugs tagged
as <code>rtf_filter</code> and <code>regression</code> are gone, thanks everyone who helped! :-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the reference here are the queries:

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>During the weekend I was in Munich to visit our second LibreOffice hackfest
this year. The archivements are detailed
<a href="http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Munich2012#Achievements">here</a>. Here
are a few interestings details I learned during this event:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Laszlo explained on the train to Munich that single line spacing is 15% of
  the font size, by definition. That finally explains why it is that the height
  of a 12pt single-line paragraph in Writer is not 240 but 276 twips.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Finally Michael motivated (and also helped!) me to improve the copy&amp;paste in
  the new RTF filter, so it seems that removing the old filter completely is
  near.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The ability to sign each other&#8217;s gpg key was a great idea. I didn&#8217;t know too
  much about this topic, so I read up on this
  <a href="http://www.phillylinux.org/keys/terminal.html">here</a>. (Additionally, the
  <code>gpg-key2ps</code> command from <code>signing-party</code>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yes, there is such a package!&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;  is useful.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
We set up a nice icecream farm from the laptops, one more aspect that boosted
  our productivity.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Speaking about icecream&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there were two reasons why I didn&#8217;t really use it:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
it required re-configuring your build tree (<code>--enable-icecream</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
it required shutting down your firewall
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It turns out none of this is really needed, so let me share the way to avoid
these problems:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
look into the
  <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=Icecream&amp;oldid=53112#Firewall">wiki</a>, you only need to open a few ports, even broadcasting/auto-discovery works with a started firewall
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
use <code>CCACHE_PREFIX="icecc" make build-nocheck PARALLELISM=30</code> to enable icecream for a single make run
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Additionally, if you run openSUSE 12.2, by default the daemon reports that the
box can&#8217;t compile x86_64 binaries (probably it hasn&#8217;t been updated to deal with
the 3.0 kernel or something), a quick workaround is to install Lubos' updated
package:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>zypper -p http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/llunak:/clang/openSUSE_12.2/ in icecream-0.9.7-64.1s.x86_64</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks for the organizers, once again this hackfest turned out to be really useful! :)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As usual, some pictures are <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vmiklos/albums/72157670949585810">available</a>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>It all started with <a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42407">this
bugreport</a> about a year ago. RTF has two different markups to describe shapes.
The old one (used till Word 6.0) is called Drawing Objects, the new one talks
about Shapes. The first picture shows the "support" for this syntax in
LibreOffice 3.4, and the situation did not change with my RTF import rework, as
I wasn&#8217;t aware of any document still using this old syntax. So when I got this
bugreport, I knew it&#8217;ll take some time to produce the correct layout, but now
during the LibreOffice conference I spent quite some time on this, and at the
end even the Hebrew text is imported correctly. ;-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Thanks to Lior who politely nagged me from time to time, this is now available
on master (see the second picture), which will become LibreOffice 4.0.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>When you want to have pages with different properties in Writer, you use page
styles. If you want to do something similar in Word, you have to use sections.
One of the benefits of page styles is that you can use them multiple times, and&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as usual with styles&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whenever you change your mind, you can edit just the
style, and all its uses will be updated consistently. There is, however, one
feature that Word sections have and we lacked so far: sections can have
different headers and footers on first, left and right pages. In Writer, you
had to use two different page styles if you wanted to achieve the same:
typically named "First page", then a "Default". This was because Writer could
differentiate only between right and left pages, not first ones.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In LibreOffice 3.7, there will be a new checkbox to "unshare" the header and
footer of the first page with right/left pages:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Right now, only ODF filters are updated to open / save this feature (as
suggested by <a href="https://wiki.oasis-open.org/office/HeaderFooterFirst">this</a> old
proposal)&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in later versions it&#8217;s planned to update the DOCX, DOC and RTF

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Given that Frugalware was founded by me, and recently James recently took over
the project leadership, I think it makes sense to look back and summarize the
past 6 years.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_beginning">The beginning</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>It all started with
<a href="http://frugalware.org/pipermail/frugalware-announce/2004-September/000001.html">this
announcement</a> about 6 years ago. It was a one-man show before, there was a
<a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/archive/frugalware-0.1/ChangeLog.txt">manually
written ChangeLog</a> but even then there were already quite a few packages, so
don&#8217;t ask me when I started hacking on this. Yes, normally there would be a
first commit in git, but remember this was before git existed, and I hated
centralized CVS so much that we didn&#8217;t use anything.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Looking back, it was all quite lame. :-) I used a mail address called "mamajom"
(English translation could be "momonkey"), tied to an ISP, with a lengthy
signature at the end of every mail I sent and was using my IRC nick instead of
my real one everywhere&#8230; OTOH, I made some decisions I&#8217;m happy about even
today. The first four developers (Ádám Zlehovszky, Krisztián Vasas, Zsolt
Szalai and me) were all Hungarian and despite of this, I forced every code,
test and documentation to be in English, to possibly turn the project into an
international one in the future. And that proved to very, very useful.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It was between 0.1 and 0.2 that we (Krisztián, Zsolt and me) showed up in a
Hungarian TV (<a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/videos/hu/">video record</a>)
explaining Frugalware. This is something never happened later for some reason.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The way we found a free hosting at a university I never attended may be also
interesting. In the grammar school, our IT teacher found my Linux distribution
idea interesting enough to support, and his friend was a teacher at the Eötvös
Loránd University, which is at the same Budapest city where I live. So, with my
friend Botond Balázs (who later was my witness at our wedding) we bought an
ultra-slow old PC (some Pentium 1 with a single HDD) and we were extremely
happy, as the uni offered to host it for free. I remember it ran some Slackware
version, as Frugalware didn&#8217;t support i586&#8230; ;-)</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_early_days">Early days</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then some more developers joined and we started to package all the usual free
software which is available in other distributions but I personally didn&#8217;t use.
Think of GNOME, Xfce, OpenOffice.org and so on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course we were still lame, the announcements still were not spellchecked by
someone native and knowledgeable enough, ending up in words like "splitted" or
"optimalization". However, we started to use an SCM (Darcs, which was horribly
slow, but at least not the centralized CVS crap). Another developer I should
mention was Bence Nagy, he came up with the idea of how we should avoid
duplication in FrugalBuilds, leading to the various package templates under
<code>source/include/</code> in the source tree.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then we went multiarch, Krisztián Hamar contributed the x86_64 port to the 0.3
release. At the same time, I invented <code>syncpkg</code>, which avoided having to build
the same package on multiple architectures manually.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We also got Gábor Lőcsei (later we met IRL and completed several bike marathons
together, resulting in a great friendship) who helped users in general on IRC,
but more importantly, for some time he did quite some bug triaging, leading to
a much better bugzilla (actually it was running Flyspray at that time) state.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The constant questions of László Csécsy (who nowadays mostly hacks
Drupal core and its modules) generated more and more improving documentation.
We first started with a LaTeX documentation, then later turned it to an
asciidoc one, in the hope of attracting more non-math contributors. ;-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then we started to have some beautiful artwork, Viktor Gondor contributed some
really cool wallpapers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, I think the last two Hungarian guys who spent a hell of a time on the
project was András Vöröskői (we still link his
<a href="http://frugalware.org/docs/getting-involved/en">getting started HOWTO</a> for new
contributors) and János Kovács. I remember for a long time I used the
home-hosted server of János when we didn&#8217;t have a fast dedicated i686 build
server and my desktop was still 32bit.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_going_international">Going international</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Then things started to happen fast. Developers outside Hungary showed up:
Gabriel Craciunescu from Germany and Michel Hermier from France worked a lot on
KDE, Gabriel also hacked a lot of the core OS, like kernel, glibc, etc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Priyank Gosalia from India started to work on GTK tools like a package manager
frontend. David Kimpe contributed a PPC port years before I got my iBook (which
I used as my primary box for a few years).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And needless to say, we still made mistakes. We thought that the development of
the original Pacman package manager slowed down, its rewrite (providing a
separate library and a console frontend, instead of one monolithic binary)
seemed to never complete, and given that we were not Archlinux developers, we
never got access to its CVS. We started to use that library API in the
installer, testcases, GUI tools, while changing the API for them wasn&#8217;t an
issue, since officially it was still unreleased. All this frustration (and
underestimating the cost of maintaining a fork) resulted in our Pacman-G2
project. First it appeared to be shiny, but once Krisztián Hamar left
Frugalware, we constantly lacked manpower and today the consensus is that with
git, maintaining a patchset over pacman.git would be far better, just nobody
did the work of merging the two projects. Pacman-G2 is in maintenance mode
today, and it still well serves its purpose, but it didn&#8217;t see any new major
feature in years.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We also saw a rewrite of the installer. The original one was written in bash,
then the second was written in C, using libdialog. And currently James works on
a third one, hopefully fixing lots of instability, resulting from the design
errors of the current one. ;-)</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_more_and_more_developers">More and more developers</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>And then somehow more and more developers came. Gourdin Gaetan (bouleetbil) and
Sébastien Vincent (Baste) worked a lot on the GNOME support, James Buren took
over the base system from me. Paolo Cretaro (Melko) does KDE bumps nowadays and
Marius Cirsta (mcirsta) did heroic work of including OpenJDK 7 into Frugalware.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Abdelmoumene Hamza (Slown) is a guy who volunteered to do a log of boring work.
When you can install a random Perl on Python module from a package, chances
that it was packaged by Slown are high. ;-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Regarding infrastructure, Benjamin Nolmans (Xarkam) stepped up, and finally
converted the data from our Flyspray instance to the more mainstream and
maintained Trac format. Regarding architectures Boris Albar (Elentir)
contributed an ARM port. Our press noise was generated by Russell Dickenson
(phayz) for a long time: he wrote newsletters regularly, and these days he
works as a documentation writer for Red Hat.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For a long time, no more Hungarians joined the project. Then Bagdán Róbert
(kikadf) came, and even if he&#8217;s rarely present on IRC, he still contributes
from time to time, and these small, but valuable contributions are what keep
Frugalware alive. :-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Regarding other big upgrades, Daniel Exner (dex) was the guy who stepped up and
finally packaged KDE4 for Frugalware. All KDE4 users meeting him should buy a
beer for him. ;-) Anthony Jorion (pingax) joined in 2010, and since then he

<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, I should not forget about Daniel Eledut (Devil505), who probably
helped me the most with my "the rest" task: he really helped out in various
areas, and he was a major Frugalware contributor for a long time.</p></div>

<h2 id="_the_end_of_my_leadership">The end of my leadership</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Contributing to other projects is something I did regularly, since every time I
got a bugreport for a package, first I created a patch to fix the problem (in
case it could not be worked around in the buildscript), and then of course
tried to upstream it, knowing the maintenance cost of non-upstreamed patches.
Still, these were minor and my main project was Frugalware for years.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The bigger contributions came when I started to complete Google Summer of Code
projects, first SWIG, then git, finally OpenOffice.org&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;which turned into
LibreOffice. The motivation is easy: these were still Free Software hacking,
but given that they are not bash hacking (like most packaging work for
Frugalware), more interesting problem had to be solved, GSoC also provided nice
payments, and needless to say: was useful to many people not using Frugalware.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea of passing over my leadership to someone else first came when I
looked back, and I saw that I spend more time on LibreOffice than on
Frugalware, even after the paid GSoC ended (later resulting in joining SUSE to
work on LibreOffice fulltime). My focus somehow just shifted from hacking a
distribution to hacking something that is directly useful for average users as
well. It&#8217;s not worse or better, it&#8217;s just different, and after lots of years, I
wanted to do something different.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To sum up, I did not reach my expectations as a project leader and I waited for
a candidate I could teach and finally who could become as good as I was in
earlier years, or hopefully even better. And then James came, who first took
over the base system, and we agreed that after 1.7, he&#8217;ll do releases. So it
was not unexpected, but still I was a bit surprised when I saw his
role-changing

But needless to say, when thinking a bit more, it was completely logical, all I
really do these days is fixing things left and right regarding my arm port
needs, and maintaining the LibreOffice package.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The idea of writing this post is not mine. However, when I thought about how
many individuals helped this project so far, I realized I really need to create
a summary, thanking their work. Reading the above, I hope that in the past
years my leadership to Frugalware were useful and I realize that these days I
have to step back, given a better leader appeared. I honestly wish the project
to see at least as many releases as we already have, now that fresh energy
leads it. :-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I tried to point out all our heroes during the last years, but it&#8217;s possible I
forgot someone. If you think you&#8217;re missing from this post, please leave a
comment. Thanks.</p></div>
