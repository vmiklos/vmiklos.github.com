<p>We have these WIP repos (stands for Work In Progress), but uploading packages there was always a manual task. This is quite unhandy when the WIP repo is being worked on for multiple months.</p><p>We already had some minimal support for WIP repos in the sync client, but it was not enough, the pacman/repoman configs were no propagated from the server to the build nodes.</p><p>I recently got some time to work on this and now it's there - once all the build nodes will be upgraded to 1.0, we will be able to use this feature without any limits. :)</p>

<p>So we got <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3678">this</a> bugreport yesterday, and I wasn't able to reproduce it on my x86 box, but I saw it on my iBook. It turns out that LESSCHARSET, which I set just for git, handles this case for me as well. At least after setting it, the manpage is correct on my iBook as well.</p><p>The weird thing is that it's still wrong for crazy@ - though I don't know if this will solve the problem of the reporter or not.</p><p>I started working on a new song in lilypond, I still like it, though no idea so far how to display a simple "A^4", it seems "a:4" does something much more complicated. ;)</p>

<p>I recently started using <a href="http://picasup.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/picUp/src/picup/picu.py">picu</a>, which is a nice tool (I just mirror pictures at Picasa as I like the comment/notify/label features of it.), but it had two annoying bugs (no proper header and too gmail-centric), so I sent <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/picu-nogmail.patch">this patch</a> upstream today.</p><p>Heh, and this is the 100th hacking post. So far it seems it was not a bad idea, I can search back "what did I hack on 22th", and sometimes I can link posts from here as a HOWTO, so writing it in English was a good decision.</p>

<p>We had this problem recently that on the console the fonts were not entirely correct, for example lat2-16.psfu.gz was replaced by lat2a-16.psfu.gz. I finally found why it was still broken in the setup: I forgot to update the Makefile to include the new font in the initrd. ;-)</p><p>Now the fonts are perfect again.</p>

<p>We recently had to move forums.fw.o to a new machine and first boobaa offered a hosting. I had only ftp access, but that isn't a big problem - the bigger one is that we have this mailing list - forums two-way gateway and we failed to configure it. They have virtual domains / mailboxes on the machine (using SQL) and the machine kept rejecting mails sent to the forums by the mailing list. After debugging for about a day, we decied to just move it an other box where there are no virtual announts, and I just had to add some trivial aliases to /etc/postfix/aliases.</p><p>Sigh.</p><p>OTOH, Frugalware 1.0rc2 is out, and now we can continue bugfixing. :-)</p>

<p>We all know the usual problem with sql escaping, there is even a <a href="http://xkcd.com/327/">comic</a> about it.</p><p>There is an other SQL-related project, <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">sphinx</a>, which is a quite efficient search indexer (especially for whole word search), but it also needs escaping. Given that in sphinx "foo-bar" means "all records containing foo, but not bar", if you really want a single-word "foo-bar", then you need to use "foo\-bar".</p><p>And that's the fun part, as the escaping order matters a lot. Basically if you escape mysql first and then just insert the sphinx query, then you just created an injection yourself. ;)</p><p>So the <em>final</em> query will look like "foo\\-bar" if you did the escaping in the right order.</p><p>It's also notable that the official sphinx php API seems not escaping the ";" char, which is also a bug, as this way you can modify the search query in the way you want.</p>

<p>I earlier wrote about I was experimenting with PowerShell, so I had to install Windows in a virtual machine. It's not a big problem, we at the uni get a license to use it for free till the end of our studies (or something like that), so I started to search for what emulator should I use.</p><p>Of course my favorite is qemu, but till I don't have kvm-enabled hw and kvm support isn't fully merged from kvm, it's slow.</p><p>Given that I had to use some other emulator, I thought I gave vmware a try, they offer a 30-day trial and I wanted to see what's new in their recent versions - I think I last tried it about 2 years ago. It seems the automagic gui screwed up something and there is no more vmware-config.pl, so I gave it up.</p><p>Last, I tried Virtualbox. Man, it's fast! Of course it's bloated as well (external kernel module, guest addons, etc) - but if I forget about these issues, it really gaves me the same experience vmware gave me when I last tried it. Impressive.</p><p>As a side note, git-1.6.2 is out, sadly I haven't got much time for it - only 5 patches of mine are in the changelog. But at least now the pdf version of the user manual is supported out of the box.</p>
