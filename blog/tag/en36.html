<p>Now that I know a little bit more about Erlang I checked how to configure vhosts with ejabberd. It turns out it's quite trivial once you understand the syntax of the config file, which is just eval'd, so it has this horrible (for an outsider) syntax. ;)</p><p>Actually configuring vhosts are just about adding the new host to the DNS and adding it to /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg, like:</p><p>{hosts, ["mydomain.org", "another.com"]}.</p><p>And that's all you need. Simple, isn't it? :)</p>

<p>So we had <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3339">this bug</a> for a while, and the <a href="http://frugalware.org/pipermail/frugalware-git/2009-March/028117.html">solution</a> was just using an other dir, so the user later can merge the contents of the two dirs.</p><p>Sigh, testing the setup still takes a lot of time. For example to test the above bug, you need to do a base install, which still takes a lot of time. Hopefully sooner or later we can switch to kvm (as the old kvm-incompatible hw gets unused) and then this can be faster.</p>

<p>The full name is Oracle Enterprise Manager Console. You can download the 10g version from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/database/oracle10g/htdocs/10201linuxsoft.html">here</a>. You can find a user/pass on bugmenot.

If you get 'no such file or directory' errors, you can just edit the relevant script and fix the path - I needed to fix /bin/rpm, /bin/awk and /bin/sed. (All of them are under /usr/bin.) A hack for the lazy ones: just symlink these to /bin, then no modification of the scripts is needed.</p><p>To your ~/.bash_login:</p><p><pre>

<p>There was a recent interview with the developers of UHU-Linux, which was the de-facto "Hungarian Linux" a few years ago here at Hungary.</p><p>The guys had a pretty closed approach and finally it seems they make money from products based on their distro - releasing something useful for the users for free is definitely not the number one task on their todo.</p><p>There were a couple of comments to the article, a few of them was about Frugalware, given that we are still the only distro where the origin is Hunagary and it's actively used outside Hungary as well.</p><p>In fact I just did a quick search, listing the last commit dates of each devel. Two of the Hungarian ones are pretty inactive. Both of them do other administrative tasks. (Buildserver / bugtracker hosting, etc.) But the rest is quite active, which was a surprise. I had the impression that lately we got some new French devels and once they got their git accounts, they got a bit less-motivated but this is simply not true. All of them (and this is true for the other non-Hungarian devels as well) was more or less active in the last month.</p><p>I think this is pretty straight-forward, even if the ohloh stat says the commit number (compared to last year) is sightly decreasing. This is a typical example: the commit number is not everything. I think this time last year we might be a bit more active overally, but that was because several devels (including me) spent a horrible amount of their free times on Frugalware, which is not something you can do for several years. Today we have a much stable devel base, increasing package maintainer community and yes, I'm happy with our current status. :)</p>

<p>I already <a href="/blog/preparing-frugalware-1-0pre2">wrote once</a> about Pootle forcing us to use UTF-8 and not respecting the po headers (where charset can be set), but there is a new chapter in this story. So in case the charset is wrong, the generated mo file is still fine, as long as you have utf8 support in your system. Of course in the setup, where we have an "as much as possible" stripped down system, this is not true.</p><p>A contributor reported this recently, and the symptom was that "sometimes" netconfig is localized, sometimes not. It turned out a bit later that it's localized when it's running in the target system's chroot (when the install of the packages is finished and the config tools are invoked), but not before the installation. Of course the previous solution worked here pretty fine as well: I just had to convert the remaining translations to utf8 manually, and then add code to convert from utf8 to the native encoding in the pre-package stage (currently named 'make prepare') of frugalwareutils.</p><p>Hand converting is boring. And sometimes it's completely messed up, for example you need an 'iconv -f utf8 -t latin1' twice to get the correct accents. ;-)</p>

<p>We had this old #3331 bug, and it turns out that Fedora had an s390 patch that fixed it.

<p>So we <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/3628">got a bugreport</a> - it seems the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/earth/thread?tid=0d0f5abd12716b7e&amp;hl=en">solution</a> is just about getting rid of the bundled libcrypto, as it's incopatible with the not-bundled libssl.</p><p>Ported erlang and postfix to ppc, the later because I wanted to use git-send-email, and I like to config postfix once, then point all the apps at postfix and then I have to change my pass only at once place when I do so.</p><p>I got an i586 machine yesterday with the "please install Linux on it for me" slogan. Sadly we at Frugalware do not support i586.

Well, I tried to. The HDD is only 1.2G, and they wanted X on it, so disabled almost everything, except X and blackbox. ;)</p><p>But honestly it just does not worth the time, people should just bin such a machine and get a life. :P</p>
