<p>yesterday somebody mentioned on #git <a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/railsconf-git-talk">this talk</a>. it's not a real video, just audio + slides but it's really nice. i would say if the "Linus one" made you say "heh, this may worth to check out" then this one will be the "hey, this one prevented me from learning things the hard way".</p><p>it's just one hour and it describes so many important tricks that i haven't encountered elsewhere yet.</p><p>just watch it.</p>

<p>uhm, this will be a long post, but i'll try to keep it short :)</p><p>a few words about fop. we write our documentation in asciidoc. asciidoc is plain text with a very simple markup, asciidoc can convert this to docbook. then docbook-xsl can convert this to .fo, finally fop can convert .fo to .pdf.</p><p>my problem with fop is that it's written in java and we just used the upstream binary. this is primarily a security problem.</p><p>so, about one and a half months ago got the crazy idea to compile fop from source. of course the correct way to do this is to package first the depends. this is really a avalanche, becase we didn't have too much generic java libs packaged, so i had to package many. namely:</p><p>jflex, piccolo, gnu.regexp, jarjar, jmock, qdox, easymock, hamcrest, iso-relax, relaxngdatatype, xsdlib, msv, xpp3, xpp2, gnu-crypto, apache-log4j, xmldb-api, ws-jaxme, dom4j, jdom, icu4j, jaxp, jaxp, xom, jaxen, rhino, batik, servletapi, jaf, gnuinetlib, gnumail, avalon-logkit, avalon-framework, commons-logging, commons-io and xmlgraphics-commons.</p><p>hm. that's 36. horrible ;)</p><p>the nice thing is that all these (except xmlgraphics-commons because classpath still lacks jpeg support) are compiled with the ecj/gcj toolchain, without any sun blob.</p><p>the other benefits are:
<ul>
  <li>a native fop binary:<pre>$ file /usr/bin/fop
/usr/bin/fop: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), for GNU/Linux 2.6.0, dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped</pre></li>
  <li>now we got rid of fop-devel, since this version can both convert ttf fonts to xml ones (needed if you want to embed custom fonts into pdf) and convert fo documents to pdf ones.</li>
</ul></p><p>yay!</p>

<p>ok, this post will be a big generic, but it seems this is still totally new to some people. so, the Message-ID header in an email is ideally unique and you can easily use it to refer to an email in an other discussion.</p><p>in this post i want to deal with 3 issues:</p><p>first, how to display it in your mail client. ok, this depends on your mue, in mutt, you need to add <pre>unignore message-id</pre> to your muttrc.</p><p>second, if you want to search for a message-id in a folder, that's your mua's task as well. in mutt, you can do it by for example <pre>~i <a href="mailto:200804281829.11866.henrikau@orakel.ntnu">200804281829.11866.henrikau@orakel.ntnu</a>.no</pre></p><p>the third trick isn't mua-specific. if you want to link the message, and the list is indexed by gmane, then you can just type <pre>http://mid.gmane.org/200804281829.11866.henrikau@orakel.ntnu.no</pre> and it'll redirect to <pre>http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/80566</pre></p><p>ok, that's all for today :)</p>

<p>a few days ago i wanted to use ungreedy regexs in javascript. first, let's see what an ungreedy regex is. look at the following example:</p><p><pre>>>> "<p>foo</p><p>bar</p>".replace(/<p>f.*<\/p>/, '')
""</pre></p><p>this is greedy. you want to get something like:</p><p><pre>"<p>bar</p>"</pre></p><p>right?</p><p>that would be ungreedy. in some other languages, there is a flag for this (php has 'U'), but in javascript, you need an other trick:</p><p><pre>>>> "<p>foo</p><p>bar</p>".replace(/<p>f.*?<\/p>/, '')
"<p>bar</p>"</pre></p><p>and yes, that's what we wanted. also it works for .+?, and so on.</p><p>ah and as a side note, it seems '.' does not match newlines, so you'll have to work around it like:</p><p><pre>>>> "<p>foo\nbar</p><p>baz</p>".replace(/<p>f[\s\S]*?<\/p>/, '')
"<p>baz</p>"</pre></p>

<p>i recently had problems with bzr -> git conversion using tailor and now Lele pulled my patches so here is a mini-howto about how i did the conversion.</p><p>i did all this in a ~/scm/tailor/bitlbee dir (to convert the bitlbee bzr repo), but of course you can do it somewhere else, too.</p><p>create the dir and place there the tailor config. mine is like:</p><p><code>
$ cat bitlbee.conf
[DEFAULT]
verbose = True
[bitlbee]
target = git:target
start-revision = INITIAL
root-directory = /home/vmiklos/scm/tailor/bitlbee
state-file = bitlbee.state
source = bzr:source
subdir = bitlbee.git
[bzr:source]
repository = /home/vmiklos/scm/tailor/bitlbee/bitlbee.bzr
[git:target]
repository = /home/vmiklos/scm/tailor/bitlbee/bitlbee.git
</code></p><p>and here is the update script:
<code>
$ cat update.sh
#!/bin/sh -e
cd <code>dirname $0</code>
cd bitlbee.bzr
bzr pull
cd ..
tailor -c bitlbee.conf
</code></p><p>to update the import daily i added the followings to my crontab:</p><p><code>
40 4 * * * ~/scm/tailor/bitlbee/update.sh &>/dev/null
</code></p><p>and we're ready, you'll have a daily updated git import.</p><p>one minor note: the bitlbee.git dir is a non-bare repo and it's also a bzr repo which is not a problem (you can clone it and gitweb handles it) but if you plan to switch to git later, you probably want to clone it once get rid of that junk :)</p>

<p>..continuing <a href="http://blogs.frugalware.org/vmiklos/2006/12/31/p276">last year's article</a>. so another year passed by and it's time to look back and see what we did during 2007. probably i miss a lot of stuff but here is my list:</p><p>1) ability to go back in the installer to a previous point if you missed something. do you remember the days when one had to reboot if he/she wanted to do so? :)</p><p>2) compiz improvements. this is now settled down in current and it's pretty sane. we cleaned up the old compiz and beryl, we have a single compiz-fusion, it has a nice step by step documentation and it works fine both for kde and gnome.</p><p>3) asciidoc. i think we highly improved our documentation since we switched from latex to asciidoc. a user manual of 98 pages in a nice pdf format is cute, isn't it? :)</p><p>4) newsletters. Alex started to issue newsletters and recently phayz helped out us, so it's alive again. i think it's something great.</p><p>5) yugo. 'factory' was our previous i686 build server, it was a very old machine with a cpu of 300mhz and so on. it was time to replace it and now yugo does the job.</p><p>6) fwlive. this was an old project but only test versions were available, based on old frugalware versions. now there is a live version of every released version of frugalware, thanks to janny, boobaa and ironiq. great!</p><p>7) gnetconfig. the first graphical config tool from priyank. i'm really bad at any graphical programming, so i'm glad to see finally we started to work on guis.</p><p>8) gfpm. something users always wanted and now it's here. a true graphical package manager, which is not just a wrapper but properly uses libpacman. awesome.</p><p>9) fun. this is our update manager which can sit on the system tray (or whatever i should call kicker not to be kde specific ;) ) and notifies you if there is something to update. i'm sure this is more comfortable compared to watching the -security mailing list for updates or doing a -Syu daily :)</p><p>10) syncpkgd2. if you remember, the old method was that there were only clients and they tried to figure out what to build, they built and uploaded the packages. this was very suboptimal: it allowed only one buildserver / arch and it was slow. okay, being slow is the smaller problem, but every buildserver was a single point of failure. nowadays we have two i686 buildservers (thanks to boobaa) and it's theoretically it's possible to have two x86_64 buildservers, too. so even if one i686 buildserver is down, i can be at the beach, sipping a mojito :)</p>

<p>git-svnimport will be removed in git-1.5.4 and i don't think it's tirival to use git-svn (which is great for bi-directional work) to properly convert an svn repo (with multiple branches) to a git one, so here is a recipe.</p><p>first, just use git-svn to create a git-svn repo. it's a git repo but it's a bit weird, it contains metadata which is necessary for bi-directional operations and you won't see the branches by default when you clone it. ah and it's not a bare repo.</p><p>in this example i'll convert ooo-build's svn repo (it has several branches and tags, so it's a good example).</p><p><code>mkdir -p ~/git/ooo-build
cd ~/git/ooo-build
git svn init -s svn+ssh://svn.gnome.org/svn/ooo-build
git svn fetch</code></p><p>this will take a while. once it's completed, you need to convert this to a bare repo:</p><p><code>mkdir ../ooo-build.git
cd ../ooo-build.git
git --bare init
git config remote.origin.url ~/git/ooo-build
git config remote.origin.fetch +refs/remotes/tags/*:refs/tags/*
git config --add remote.origin.fetch +refs/remotes/trunk:refs/heads/master
git config --add remote.origin.fetch +refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*
git fetch
</code></p><p>and you're done! :)</p><p>of course this is an incremental operation, so all you need is to run git svn fetch and git fetch from cron to keep the mirror up to date.</p><p>update:</p><p>it turns out you can even do this by having only one git repo. it has benefints: you don't have to duplicate the object database. and it has one problem: if you later switch fully to git, then you want to remove the git-svn metadata - doing so is the easiest if you just clone the repo.</p><p>so - in case you want this, you have to:</p><p><code>mkdir -p ~/git/ooo-build.git
cd ~/git/ooo-build.git
git --bare init
git --bare svn init -s svn+ssh://svn.gnome.org/svn/ooo-build
git --bare svn fetch</code></p><p>and then you can fetch from yourself:</p><p><code>
git config remote.origin.url .
git config remote.origin.fetch +refs/remotes/tags/*:refs/tags/*
git config --add remote.origin.fetch +refs/remotes/*:refs/heads/*
git fetch
</code></p><p>note: git config --add remote.origin.fetch +refs/remotes/trunk:refs/heads/master it unnecessary as git svn fetch will update this for you (it is different from git fetch)</p><p>thanks for devurandom from #git for pointing out that this is possible using git --bare init before git svn init and using git --bare svn fetch :)</p>
