<p>..continuing <a href="http://blogs.frugalware.org/vmiklos/2006/12/31/p276">last year's article</a>. so another year passed by and it's time to look back and see what we did during 2007. probably i miss a lot of stuff but here is my list:</p><p>1) ability to go back in the installer to a previous point if you missed something. do you remember the days when one had to reboot if he/she wanted to do so? :)</p><p>2) compiz improvements. this is now settled down in current and it's pretty sane. we cleaned up the old compiz and beryl, we have a single compiz-fusion, it has a nice step by step documentation and it works fine both for kde and gnome.</p><p>3) asciidoc. i think we highly improved our documentation since we switched from latex to asciidoc. a user manual of 98 pages in a nice pdf format is cute, isn't it? :)</p><p>4) newsletters. Alex started to issue newsletters and recently phayz helped out us, so it's alive again. i think it's something great.</p><p>5) yugo. 'factory' was our previous i686 build server, it was a very old machine with a cpu of 300mhz and so on. it was time to replace it and now yugo does the job.</p><p>6) fwlive. this was an old project but only test versions were available, based on old frugalware versions. now there is a live version of every released version of frugalware, thanks to janny, boobaa and ironiq. great!</p><p>7) gnetconfig. the first graphical config tool from priyank. i'm really bad at any graphical programming, so i'm glad to see finally we started to work on guis.</p><p>8) gfpm. something users always wanted and now it's here. a true graphical package manager, which is not just a wrapper but properly uses libpacman. awesome.</p><p>9) fun. this is our update manager which can sit on the system tray (or whatever i should call kicker not to be kde specific ;) ) and notifies you if there is something to update. i'm sure this is more comfortable compared to watching the -security mailing list for updates or doing a -Syu daily :)</p><p>10) syncpkgd2. if you remember, the old method was that there were only clients and they tried to figure out what to build, they built and uploaded the packages. this was very suboptimal: it allowed only one buildserver / arch and it was slow. okay, being slow is the smaller problem, but every buildserver was a single point of failure. nowadays we have two i686 buildservers (thanks to boobaa) and it's theoretically it's possible to have two x86_64 buildservers, too. so even if one i686 buildserver is down, i can be at the beach, sipping a mojito :)</p>
