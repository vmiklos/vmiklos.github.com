</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>TL;DR: see above&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it&#8217;s now possible signing existing PDF files and also
verify those signatures in LibreOffice 5.3.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_the_problem">The problem</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>LibreOffice already made it possible to digitally sign PDF files as part of
the PDF export, so in case you had e.g. ODF documents and exported them to
PDF, optionally a single digital signature could be added as part of the
export process. This is now much improved. First, thanks to the Dutch Ministry
of Defense in cooperation with <a href="http://nouenoff.nl/">Nou&amp;Off</a> who made this work
possible.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A user can already use an other application to verify that signature or sign
an already existing PDF file. The idea is to allow doing these from inside
LibreOffice, directly.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_results">Results</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>As it can be seen above, now the Digital Signatures dialog not only works for
ODF and OOXML files, but also for PDF files. If the file has been signed, then
the dialog performs verifications of that signature. Signatures are also
verified on opening any signed PDF file.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve also extended the user interface a bit, so that signing an existing PDF
file is easy, similarly how exporting to PDF is easier than exporting to a
random other file format. There is now a new File &#8594; Digital signatures &#8594;
Sign exiting PDF menu item to open a PDF file for signing:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/30/31543378146_b33c2f0a83_o.png">
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/30/31543378146_b981a22ee0_z.jpg" alt="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/30/31543378146_b981a22ee0_z.jpg" />
</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When that happens the infobar has a dedicated button to open the Digital
Signatures dialog, and also going into editing mode triggers a warning dialog,
as going read-write is not needed to be able to sign a document:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/31543377356_d359124361_o.png">
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/31543377356_eaed7c2301_z.jpg" alt="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/752/31543377356_eaed7c2301_z.jpg" />
</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And that&#8217;s basically it, after you open a PDF file in Draw, you can do the
usual digital signature operations on the file, just like it already works for
previously supported file formats.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_details">Details</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>What follows is something you can probably skip if you&#8217;re a user&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;however if
you&#8217;re a developer and you want to understand how the above is implemented,
then read on. ;-)</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pdf_tokenizer">PDF tokenizer</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The signing feature in ODF/OOXML is implemented by working directly on the ZIP
storage in <code>xmlsecurity/</code>. This means that in the PDF case it&#8217;s necessary to
work on the PDF file directly, except that we had no such PDF tokenizer
ready to be used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Code under <code>xmlsecurity/source/pdfio/</code> now is such a tokenizer that can
extract info from PDF files and can also add incremental updates at the end of
the file, this way we can make sure adding a signature to a file won&#8217;t loose
existing content in the file. This is fundamentally different form the usual
load-edit-save workflow, when we convert the file into a document model, and
work on that.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_verification_of_signatures">Verification of signatures</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Previously LO was only able to generate signatures, not verify them. I&#8217;ve
implemented PDF signature verification using both NSS and CryptoAPI, so all
Windows, Linux and macOS are covered. I have to admit that the initial verification
was much easier with CryptoAPI. Until I hit corner-cases, I could use an API
that&#8217;s well-documented and is higher level than NSS. (I don&#8217;t have to support
different hash types explicitly, for example.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When I added support for non-detached signatures, that changed the situation a bit:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code> 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+), 11 deletions(-)</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>was the NSS patch, and</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code> 1 file changed, 104 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>was the CryptoAPI patch.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_signing_existing_files">Signing existing files</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Signing an existing file means tokenizing a document, figuring out how an
incremental update should look like for that file, writing an incremental
update that has a placeholder for the actual signature (a PKCS#7 blob, where
the input is just the non-placeholder parts of the document as binary data), and
finally filling in the placeholder with the actual signature.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the last step, I could reuse code from the PDF export (modulo fixing bugs
like <a href="https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=99327">tdf#99327</a>).
For the other steps, the tokenizer remembers the input offset / length for the
given token, this way it&#8217;s relatively easy to create incremental updates. You
can add new objects or update new objects in such an incremental update, and
this source tracking feature allows copying even the unchanged parts of
updated objects verbatim.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pdf_1_5">PDF 1.5+</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Everything becomes a bit more complicated once I started to handle not only
LO-generated PDF-1.4, but also newer PDF versions. I think this is important,
as Adobe Acrobat creates PDF 1.6 by default today, which has a number of new
features (I think all of them were actually introduced in PDF-1.5) that
affects the tokenizer:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
xref stream: instead of an ASCII xref table ("table of contents") at the end
  of the file, it&#8217;s now possible to write the binary equivalent of this as an
  xref stream. Because the binary version can describe more features we must
  also write an updated xref stream (and not an xref table) when the import
  already had an xref stream.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
object streams: it&#8217;s now possible to write multiple objects inside the
  stream section of a single object in binary form. The tokenizer is necessary
  to be able to read these objects and also roundtripping (source tracking)
  should work not only with physical file offsets, but also inside such
  compressed streams where the offset is no longer just a number inside the
  input file. (It&#8217;s OK to write the updated objects outside object streams,
  still.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
stream predictors: this is a concept from the PNG format, but also used in
  PDF when compressing the xref stream. See the spec for the gory details, but
  in short it&#8217;s not enough that instead of plaintext you have to deal with
  binary compressed data, you also have to filter the data before actually
  parsing the file offsets, and the filter is defined not in terms of object IDs
  and file offsets, but in terms of adjacent pixels, since it&#8217;s documented in
  the PNG spec. :-) (To be close to the Adobe output, we also apply such
  predictors when writing compressed xref streams.)
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_user_interface">User Interface</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In addition to be UI changes already mentioned above, one more improvement I
did is that now the Digital Signatures dialog has a new column to show the
signature type.  This is either XML-DSig (for ODF/OOXML) or PDF.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_testing">Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;ve added an integration test in the existing
<code>CppunitTest_xmlsecurity_signing</code> to have coverage for the small new code that
calls into <code>xmlsecurity/</code> from <code>sfx2/</code> in case of PDF files. But fortunately
because all other code in <code>xmlsecurity/</code> was new, I could do unit testing in
<code>CppunitTest_xmlsecurity_pdfsigning</code> for the rest of the features.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Needless to say that invoking the PDF tokenizer + signature creator/verifier
directly is <strong>much</strong> quicker than loading a full PDF file into Draw, just to see
the signature status. ;-)</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you want to try these out yourself, get a
<a href="http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/">daily build</a> and play with it! This
work is part of both <code>master</code> or <code>libreoffice-5-3</code>, so those builds are of
interest. Happy testing! :-)</p></div>
