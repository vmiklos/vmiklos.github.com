</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When using text frames in Writer, you can always choose if you set an absolute
size for it or you set a relative one. Oddly enough, in case of relative
sizes, it wasn&#8217;t entirely clear what 100% percent means. With a bit of
<a href="https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Type#Relative">searching</a>, the help says
"it&#8217;s the page text area", which in practice means the page size, excluding
the margins.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And that&#8217;s where the problem lies: in many cases (importing foreign formats,
cover page of a document, etc.) you want to have a textframe which is 100%
wide, compared to the full page size, including margins. It was already
possible previously to work this around by manually specifying the same size
what was used for page size, but that&#8217;s ugly, you duplicate the setting at two
places.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As you can see on the above screenshot, in LibreOffice 4.3, I now implemented
this as a new option, you can choose what 100% means for both width and
height. File filters are also updated accordingly: in case of ODF an
<a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/ODF_Implementer_Notes#LibreOffice_ODF_extensions">extension</a>
is proposed, and also DOCX and RTF filters are updated, where the file format
already supported this feature.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the curious ones, the feature is in <code>master</code> for almost two months now,
but I only implemented my favorite part&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;RTF filter&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;only last week,
that&#8217;s the "news" here. ;-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you want to try these out yourself, get a
<a href="http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/">daily build</a> and play with it! If
something goes wrong, report it to us in the
<a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/bug/">Bugzilla</a>, so we can try fix it
before 4.3 gets branched off. Last, but not at least, thanks for
<a href="http://www.cloudon.com/">CloudOn</a> for funding this improvement! :-)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m sure in this case a few words are worth more than the above picture, so
let me describe what you see above. :-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In case of opening an ODT, DOC or RTF document in LibreOffice Writer, you
already got some feedback on where the importer is, in case the process needed
more time than what you feel "instant". However, this wasn&#8217;t supported for
DOCX.  According to <code>git blame</code>, I added this to my todo on 2012-10-29, and a
few months later also a
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58044">bugreport</a> was opened,
requesting the same, but up to yesterday, nothing changed.  However, now I&#8217;ve
implemented this on master, it&#8217;ll be part of the 4.3 release.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Back to where I started, what you actually see there is when LibreOffice is in
the middle of the import process of the Holy Bible in DOCX format, which takes
around 12 seconds on my machine. One could say that speed up quite acceptable
for that amount of data, but with a progressbar, it&#8217;s definitely better. ;-)</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Last year in September we
<a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/libreoffice/2013-September/055976.html">decided</a>
to get rid of the writerfilter-based DOC tokenizer, and I volunteered to
actually do this. As cleanups in general have a low priority, I only
progressed with this slowly, though yesterday I completed it, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m
writing this post. :-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some background: the writerfilter module is responsible for RTF and DOCX
import in Writer. As the above picture shows, the currently used DOC import is
independent from it, and there was also an <em>other</em> DOC import filter, that was
in writerfilter which was disabled at runtime. As I don&#8217;t like duplication, I
examined the state of the two filters, and the linked minutes mail details
how we decided that the old filter will stay, and we&#8217;ll get rid of the
writerfilter one. It&#8217;s just a matter of deleting that code, right? :-) That&#8217;s
what I thought first. But then I had to realize that the architecture of
writerfilter is a bit more complex:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vBMsCsYLRZE/UxxG3PsuI2I/AAAAAAAAEFc/Ly8sQ0ydY1A/s831/">
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vBMsCsYLRZE/UxxG3PsuI2I/AAAAAAAAEFc/Ly8sQ0ydY1A/s400/" alt="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vBMsCsYLRZE/UxxG3PsuI2I/AAAAAAAAEFc/Ly8sQ0ydY1A/s400/" />
</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It has the following components:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
the dmapper (domain mapper), that handles all the nasty complexities of
  mapping Word concepts to Writer concepts (think of e.g. sections ↔ page
  styles)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
one tokenizer for each (RTF, DOCX, DOC) format
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The traffic between the tokenizers and dmapper is called tokens. Naturally
it&#8217;s not enough that tokenizers send and dmapper receives these tokens, they
should be <em>defined</em> somewhere as well. And that&#8217;s where I realized this work
will take a bit more time: instead of having a single token definition,
actually the ooxml tokenizer defined its own grammar, and doctok also defined
two <em>additional</em> grammars. And of course dmapper had to handle all of that.
;-) Given that OOXML is a superset of the DOC/RTF format, it makes sense to
just use the ooxml grammar, and get rid of the other two.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Especially that&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by now you probably found this out&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if I wanted to kill
doctok, I had to kill the sprm and rtf grammars as well. Otherwise just
removing doctok would break the RTF and DOCX import as well, as those also
used the rtf/sprm grammars.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So at the end, the cleaned up architecture now looks like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<a class="image" href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iki8jKN61vE/UxxG3FaQc2I/AAAAAAAAEFQ/hWFsR20qB5o/s813/">
<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iki8jKN61vE/UxxG3FaQc2I/AAAAAAAAEFQ/hWFsR20qB5o/s400/" alt="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Iki8jKN61vE/UxxG3FaQc2I/AAAAAAAAEFQ/hWFsR20qB5o/s400/" />
</a>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And that has multiple advantages:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
It removes quite some code: In <code>libreoffice-4-1</code>, the doctok was 78849 (!)
  lines of code (well, part of that was XML data, and some scripts generated
  C++ code from that).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
dmapper now doesn&#8217;t have to handle the rtf and sprm grammars anymore, so now
  there is a <em>single</em> place in dmapper that handles e.g. the italic character
  property.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Smaller writerfilter binary for the end user: even if doctok wasn&#8217;t enabled
  at runtime, it was shipped in the installation set.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hopefully it&#8217;s now a bit more easy to understand writerfilter: at least e.g.
  if you want to look up the place where dmapper handles the character bold
  ("b") XML tag of OOXML, you don&#8217;t have to know that the binary DOC
  equivalent of that is sprmCFBold, just because we have an unused DOC tokenizer
  there as well. :-)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Given that DOC and RTF formats are a dead end, I think it&#8217;s a good thing
  that in writerfilter now <em>the</em> grammar is OOXML (that keeps introducing new
  features), rather than some dead format. ;-)
</p>

<div class="paragraph"><p>If you ever tried to use nested comments in Writer (make a selection, Insert
&#8594; Comment, then make an overlapping selection, and do it again), you may have
noticed that only the ODF filter can load and save such a document properly.
Recently I have improved this situation a lot. Motivated by seeing this is now
supported in the DOCX import filter, I now added support for this also to the
DOCX export, RTF import/export and binary DOC import/export filters.</p></div>

(<a href="/blog/lo-writer-drawingml-shape-improvements.html#disqus_thread">Comments</a>)
</p><p><div class="paragraph"><p>Although LibreOffice 4.2.0 is
<a href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan/4.2">not yet released</a>, it was
already branched off from <code>master</code> in November last year, and improvements for
the next release are already cooking in <code>master</code>. One of these will be a major
improvement of shape handling in the DOCX import/export filter.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some background: when DOCX was initially introduced, it still used
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language">VML</a> (which is in short
an XML equivalent of the binary shape format), and only Word 2010 started to
write shapes using
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML_file_formats#DrawingML">drawingML</a>.
Given that Word still understands VML, it wasn&#8217;t urgent for us to write shapes
using the drawingML markup. As for import, Word still writes an approximate
version of the shape in VML as a fallback&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that&#8217;s what we read till now.
Needless to say, newer drawingML features have no VML equivalent so with time
it became more and more important for us to finally read and write shapes in
DOCX using drawingML, which just happened in Writer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I&#8217;m posting here a few screenshots showing the improvements I&#8217;ve implemented.
Note that final 4.3 is still far from being released, so this is not a
complete list. :-) In each case I&#8217;m providing a screenshot showing how it
looked (at the end of an import/export/import again roundtrip) <em>before</em>, how
it looks <em>now</em> in 4.3 and the <em>reference</em> layout. Click on the images to get a

<div class="paragraph"><p>You may remember that I wrote about my little
<a href="http://vmiklos.hu/blog/ged2dot.html">ged2dot project</a> about two months ago.
It&#8217;s a Python script that can be used from commandline with quite some
options. I&#8217;m happy to announce that there is a GUI for it now, in the form of
a LibreOffice Draw import filter. If you open
<a href="https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/blob/master/test/screenshot.ged">this GEDCOM
file</a>, you&#8217;ll see something similar to the above image.  You can simply build
the <code>.oxt</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot">Git repo</a>, or just get
it from the
<a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/gedcom">LibreOffice
Extensions site</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Technical details for the interested readers: the import filter just glues
together existing pieces. First it runs <code>ged2dot</code>, then <code>dot</code> to generate an
SVG. To keep things simple, then the filter "inlineizes" all the included
images, finally the already existing SVG import filter does the real work. I
find it elegant that each step works from and to the memory, and not ugly
temporary files. :-) It works on Linux and Windows, feedback on if it works on
Mac is appreciated.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, if you ask why this is an extension, not part of LibreOffice core: I
guess most users are not interested in building family trees; also being
someone who works on the core most of the time, I wanted to try out how
implementing an import filter as an extension (filter detection, import
options dialog, etc.) works. ;-)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>This year&#8217;s Software Freedom Day event was held yesterday at Szeged, here at
Hungary. I gave a talk about the news of LibreOffice 4.1 / 4.2
(<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/4-dot-2-es-kiadasban">slides</a>), and I was
happy to notice there were other LibreOffice-related talks as well:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>

<p>
Péter Mátó was talking about
  <a href="http://sfd.org.hu/egy-uj-magyar-fejlesztes-koezponti-rendszer-menedzsment">central

<div class="paragraph"><p>It was pointed out that LibreOffice Writer is only able to open, not save
<code>.dot</code> (Word binary template) files. From mso-dumper experience, I knew that
the difference is quite small between <code>.doc</code> (which we already export) and
<code>.dot</code> files. The feature freeze for LibreOffice 4.2 is here next week, so why
not adding this feature before that deadline? You can see above the result. :-)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For the ones who love our <code>--convert-to</code> commandline switch, an extra fix was
necessary to make <code>--convert-to dot</code> work as well, both commits are now in
master. You can try it out yourself using a
<a href="http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/">daily build</a> or just wait for the
<code>libreoffice-4-2</code> branchoff and the first beta from that branch.</p></div>
