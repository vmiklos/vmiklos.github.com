<p>so, one of my friends called me a few days ago, saying 'hi, i got this eee pc, it's shipped with win xp, could you please install frugalware on it, making it dual-bootable?'.</p><p>today i got the gadget, i had about 3 hours to play with it, so i did not have much time.</p><p>first, there was an <a href="http://git.frugalware.org/gitweb/gitweb.cgi?p=setup.git;a=commit;h=6928ab07c4de2797ffb9a7edb6f0da24c80e82e1">installer bug</a>, but fortunately it was trivial to fix it up. second, the internal wifi card is not supported by 2.6.26, so i made a kernel package from <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/bmf/frugalware-i686/kernel-2.6.26-2bmf1-i686.fpm">2.6.27-rc6</a> and made a custom usb installer using that kernel.</p><p>once that was ok, the installation went fairly easy. minor problems were that the netinstall by default wants to use ftp but we were behind a proxy, so we needed http. and other problem was that there were two ntfs partitions, the second was empty, i just formatted it as ext3, using it as /, but i did not set the partition type from ntfs to linux and grub refused to install because of my laziness.</p><p>i did not want to do a full install but i needed network, so i installed base+network. once that was fine, i installed some other packages/groups: acpi, mc, x11 and kdebase.</p><p>so far what i saw working:</p><p><ul>
  <li>wireless, that was working in the netinstall as well after the kernel update</li>
  <li>touchpad</li>
  <li>xorg, using that 1024x600 custom resolution.</li>
  <li>acpi reported the correct battery status</li>
</ul></p><p>unfortunately i had no more time to play with it, so i did not check how suspend, 3d acceleration, ethernet card and webcam works.</p><p>in short, i think it's nice it has no major problems, but probably it's hard for non-developers to install it as long as we don't have kernel-2.6.27 in current.</p>
