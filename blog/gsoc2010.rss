&gt; Dear Miklos,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; Congratulations! Your proposal "&lt;a href="http://vmiklos.hu/doc/gsoc-2k1o.html"&gt;Improve RTF Export&lt;/a&gt;" as submitted to "Go
&gt; OpenOffice" has been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2010. Over the next
&gt; few days, we will add you to the private Google Summer of Code Student
&gt; Discussion List. Over the next few weeks, we will send instructions to this
&gt; list regarding turn in proof of enrollment, tax forms, etc.
&gt;
&gt; Now that you've been accepted, please take the opportunity to speak with
&gt; your mentors about plans for the Community Bonding Period: what
&gt; documentation should you be reading, what version control system will you
&gt; need to set up, etc., before start of coding begins on May 24th.
&gt;
&gt; Welcome to Google Summer of Code 2010! We look forward to having you with
&gt; us.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; With best regards,
&gt; The Google Summer of Code Program Administration Team
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
