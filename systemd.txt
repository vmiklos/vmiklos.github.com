I first heard about
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd[systemd] from
http://frugalware.org/~voroskoi/[voroskoi], later
http://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/[Michael] pointed it out again
during the http://www.ooocon.org/index.php/ooocon/2010[OOoCon 2010],
finally it somehow came up on `#frugalware.dev` today.

So I read up some documentation in this area, and I definitely like it.
(Note: I didn't say I'm willing to do all the work to integrate this
into Frugalware, but I like the idea.) For me, the killer post is
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/systemd-for-admins-3.html[this one]: a
distro-independent init script in 8 lines is very much like our
`FrugalBuild` scripts which are no longer than 11 lines for a project
with a standard build-system.

I like that minimalism a lot.
