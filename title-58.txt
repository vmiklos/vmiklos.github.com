probably irssi users know <a href="http://f0rked.com/code/irssi/anames.pl">anames.pl</a>, a clone of /names, with away nicks grayed out. the sympthom is that new away information need to be obtained manually by executing a /who on a channel. the real problem behind that is that if you use redirection, then the away infos aren't updated. so i've made a workaround for that: at least this calls /who automatically. you can reach my patch <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/anames.diff">here</a>.
(the sollution would be to<ul>
  <li>finding a way to mute /who</li>
  <li>fixing this redirection stuff in irssi ;)</li>
</ul>)
