today's project is <a href="http://darcs.frugalware.org/repos/pacman-tools/fwmirror">fwmirror</a>, a handy tool to mirror Frugalware archives. basically it handles the followings:
<ul>
  <li>it needs a server, if you want the newest stuff and don't care about being slow, then you need "rsync://rsync.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/"</li>
  <li>it handles different Frugalware versions (NOTE: since -current has a new structure, versions other than -current will be supported by fwmirror only after 0.5)</li>
  <li>it handles different architectures, including the special "source" one</li>
  <li>it allows you to pass any custom options to rsync</li>
</ul>

ok, not a big deal, but useful, isn't it? :)
