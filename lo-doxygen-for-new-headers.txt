title: LibreOffice's git-hooks now warn about undocumented classes
author: Miklos

There was a thread about this topic already, but just refusing to commit
new files without documentation sounded too aggressive. So the
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/bootstrap/commit/?id=5e7d47da56c9b35331756bcb915b23e2f14a62d6[current
code] just prints a warning.

It was also requested to show some good/bad examples. Lubos
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/2938/focus=5389[volunteered]
to add detailed instructions in the wiki, so I'm just describing in
short what did I test so far.

A good example:

[source,cpp]
----
/// Handles export of foos using RTF markup
class RtfFoo
{
};
----

A bad example:

[source,cpp]
----
class RtfBarBuggy
{
};
----

Example output when a warning is emitted:

----
~/git/libreoffice/master/sw$ git commit -a -m foo
sw/source/filter/ww8/bar.hxx:30: warning: Compound RtfBarBuggy is not documented.
[master 1b11571] foo
