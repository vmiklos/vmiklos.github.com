i've worked again a bit on mkiso:<ul>
  <li>now you can (optionally) define a <lang> tag, so that after the frugalware repo, not all the locale-extra pkgs will have higher priority than the other extra pkgs, just a selected language's locale pkgs</li>
  <li>it generates a small stat next to the iso, for example the current ones are available for a while <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/stats/iso/">here</a></li>
</ul>

have fun! :)
