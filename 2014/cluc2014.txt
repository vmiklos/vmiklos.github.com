I've arrived home yesterday from Zagreb where I
http://2014.dorscluc.org/en/keynotes/#miklos[gave a keynote] at CLUC 2014
http://2014.dorscluc.org/en/conference-schedule/[on Tuesday].

Here are a few talks I enjoyed:

- Dave Whiteland's https://www.mysociety.org/[mysociety.org] talk
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald_Welte[Harald Welte]'s
  http://osmocom.org/[osmocom.org] talk
- Elizabeth Krumbach Joseph's http://openstack.org[OpenStack] talk (explaining
  how do they use gerrit, git-review and related tools)

I also took a link:/panoramas/zagreb.html[panorama] and some
pictures, available

including photos of some speakers.

Thanks Elizabeth for the above photo, and also to the organizers of the
conference, it was a great one! ;-)
