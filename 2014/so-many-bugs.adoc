From time to time developers feel that they have little time, but they would
want to take care of many bugs. Last week I was frustrated enough to actually
design a T-shirt for just that. ;-)

Above is how it looks like. In case you don't get the joke, see
http://nabble.documentfoundation.org/Building-LibreOffice-from-an-IDE-td4083960.html[here]
for a hint. Oh, and if you would like to build your own binary... err T-shirt,
you can do it:
http://people.freedesktop.org/~vmiklos/2014/bugs-tshirt.odg[here] is the ODG
file that can serve as a source. Happy bugfixing! :-)
