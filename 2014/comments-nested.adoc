If you ever tried to use nested comments in Writer (make a selection, Insert
-> Comment, then make an overlapping selection, and do it again), you may have
noticed that only the ODF filter can load and save such a document properly.
Recently I have improved this situation a lot. Motivated by seeing this is now
supported in the DOCX import filter, I now added support for this also to the
DOCX export, RTF import/export and binary DOC import/export filters.

If you want to try this out, core.git has a

and

samples to play with.
