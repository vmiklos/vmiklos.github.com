This year's LibreOffice conference was held in Bern, Switzerland. Links to my slides:

During the sessions I also had some time to hack on the followings:

- RTF export: added support for custom wrap polygon of Writer pictures
- fixed https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82067[fdo#82067]
  FILEOPEN: RTF images not in correct position
- fixed https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82078[fdo#82078]
  FILEOPEN: RTF bold text spilling over to non-bold text
- fixed http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10039[abi#10039] crasher
  on RTF export of page-anchored pictures

Regarding the number of attendees, draw your own conclusions from the

Thanks for the organizers for this beautiful event -- and also the sponsors!
