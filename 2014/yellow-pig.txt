It turns out LibreOffice's RTF and DOCX import filter ignored borders around Writer
pictures. Given that this
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85179[worked] in the RTF case in
the past, it's a bit amusing that now the very same commit implements a new
feature for the DOCX case and at the same time fixes a regression in the RTF
filter. Code sharing FTW! :-)
