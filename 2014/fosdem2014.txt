I've arrived home yesterday from Brussels where I
https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/interopgrabbag_in_libreoffice_writer/[presented]
at FOSDEM 2014, in the
https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/open_document_editors/[Open document
editors devroom].

We also had a
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/FOSDEM2014[Hackfest], kindly
hosted by http://www.betacowork.com/[Betacowork] on Monday and Tuesday.

Here are a few talks I enjoyed, not counting the LibreOffice ones:

- https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/simplifying_reuse_with_metadata_support_in_odf_and_plugin_apis/[Simplifying
  reuse with metadata support in ODF and plugin APIs] -- finally a simple way
  to copy&paste images from Firefox to LibreOffice with source attribution.
- https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/valgrind_gdb/[Combining the power of
  Valgrind and GDB] -- useful to know about this possibility
- https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/usecasesclangcppparser/[Two uses
  cases for the clang C++ parser: Online Code Browser and Qt moc Replacement.]
  -- maybe the first could replace our crappy Java-based opengrok? We'll see.

I was also happy to meet Jacobo, Matus, Tim and TomaÅ¾ finally personally. :-)

Quite some other slides are now available on
http://planet.documentfoundation.org/[Planet], don't miss them. I also took
some pictures, available
