Last year I
https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/libreoffice-writer-training[published] some
Writer training slides, which are hopefully a useful extension to in-tree
documentation like
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/tree/sw/README[sw/README] and
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/tree/sw/qa/extras/README[sw/qa/extras/README].

Last week I reviewed those slides and realized that some of them are outdated. So here comes an updated version:

- https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/writer-training-number-1-2014[first part],
  up to, but not including layout
- https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/writer-training-number-2-2014[second part],
  starting from the layout

The intention is that these build nicely on top of Michael's
https://people.gnome.org/~michael/blog/2013-07-26.html[generic intro] slides,
and with that, the reader can have a good "big picture" understanding of the
code base. For the gory details, you always need to read the code anyway. ;-)
