If you ever used the
https://help.libreoffice.org/Writer/Mail_Merge_Wizard[mail merge wizard] with
data sources, then you know how it works: it typically needs some kind of data
source (e.g. a Calc spreadsheet), a Writer document containing the email or
letter (that contains fields), and then mail merge can generate the
personalized documents for you.

In case you have an existing document where you already have such data in a
Writer table, you had to somehow transfer it to one of the formats for which
there was a data source driver, and then you could use it inside mail merge.
I've now added a dedicated Writer driver in `connectivity/`, so picking up
data directly from Writer tables is now possible.

If you are interested how this looks like, here is a demo (click on the image

That's it for now -- as usual the commits are in master, so you can try this
right now with a 6.0 http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/master/[daily
build]. :-)
