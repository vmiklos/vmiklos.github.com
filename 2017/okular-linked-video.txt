I rarely write about work did by others, but given that in the
link:/blog/pdf-video-export.html[previous post] I mentioned that linked videos
(when they are a http:// URL) are not working, I had a very positive
experience which is worth noting. :-)

I got a private mail nagging me to file a
https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=376574[bug] and just 3 days later it got
fixed!

Thanks to both Oliver for the nagging and to Albert for the actual fix.
