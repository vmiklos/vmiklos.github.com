Last weekend I attended the LibreOffice
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Perugia2017[Perugia] HackFest
2017, with the primary goal of mentoring students (together with
http://erack.org/blog/[Eike] and Christian): provided they manage to
contribute at least one non-trivial easy hack, they get university credits for
their work.

I worked with https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/38160[Arianna],
https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/38159[Claudio],
https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/38161[Francesco] and
https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/38134[Gian], all of them managed to
achieve something by the end of the third day.

When I was not helping others, I also fixed a few bugs:

- https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107976[tdf#107976] sw: let a view handle multiple transferables
- https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107837[tdf#107837] DOCX export: fix balanced multi-col section at doc end
- https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=107684[tdf#107684] DOCX export: fix duplicated <w:outlineLvl> element for styles
- https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106950[tdf#106950] sw: support CharShadingValue property on paragraph styles

Some photos I took during the event are https://www.flickr.com/photos/vmiklos/albums/72157681387507534[available].

Thanks the organizers for the great event, also kudos to
https://www.collaboraoffice.com/[Collabora], Red Hat and TDF for allowing
mentors to come! :-)
