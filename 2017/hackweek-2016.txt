As mentioned in
https://mikekaganski.wordpress.com/2016/12/11/my-first-hack-rest-of-the-week-at-collabora/[the
blog post of Mike] already, last month we were allowed to hack on anything we
want in LibreOffice for a few days. I used this time to progress with 3
different topics.

== Stepping through TextBoxes using the keyboard

Given that a Writer shape with a TextBox is internally two shapes, this needed
explicit support. After my
https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commitdiff;h=5d2c189aee5057d1533165c368227c9c4c49d330[TextBox
bugfix] it's possible to have two such shapes in a document, and once you
select one of them, tab properly jumps between the two shapes; previously
nothing happened.

What did happen is we tried to activate the TextBox of the selected shape,
which selected the shape itself, so at the end nothing happened.

== RTF improvements

For some time it was already possible to import and export custom string
document properties from/to RTF, but just in case the value type of the
property was string. Now I extended support for these custom properties, so
also the remaining types are handled:

== xmlsec patch upstreaming

Last, I've started working on upstreaming
`external/libxmlsec/xmlsec1-noverify.patch.1`. xmlsec has no ability to
disable the verification of certificates (think of `curl -k` or `wget -k`), so
in LibreOffice currently we just patch out that code as we don't need it. So I
wanted to add a new verification flag to avoid patching, but it turns out that
in the NSS case xmlsec didn't do the verification, so as a first step I fixed
that instead in this https://github.com/lsh123/xmlsec/pull/72[xmlsec GitHub
pull request]. Now that it's merged, the next step will be to add such a flag,
and then LibreOffice can get rid of the patch after the next xmlsec release.
