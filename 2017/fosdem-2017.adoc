https://fosdem.org/2017/[FOSDEM 2017] is here this weekend, and as Michael
Stahl pointed out, this (together with the LibreOffice annual conference) are
two time periods each year when lots of Impress bugfixes are made, as people
start https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food[dogfooding]. ;-)
So below you can read about a pair of Impress bugs I fixed recently.

== Changing font size now takes table selection into account

https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105502[tdf#105502] is a
situation where you have an Impress table shape, and you select part of the
cells, then you click on the sidebar to change the font size. Previously this
affected all cells of the table shape, now only the selected cells are
updated.

== Background fill for shapes

https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105150[tdf#105150] is a
PPT(X) filter bug where a shape was previously imported as transparent, but it
actually has to have the same fill type as the slide background. In case of
PPTX this was already handled in general, but not in case the slide had no
explicit background. The result was that in case the shape was used to cover
other shapes, they were visible, leading to e.g. this unexpected red rectangle
on the screenshot.

The same bug was present in the PPT import, though there existing support was
even more limited: just the "background colored objects" were collected, but
nothing was done to them. Now the above use-case should be as good for PPT as
it is for PPTX.
