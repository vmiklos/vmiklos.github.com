So we had
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/844[this
script] with Jonas, and the current news about it is that it's mentioned
by in https://lwn.net/Articles/414051/[this LWN article]. I just
innocently read the article and noticed:

After ten years, the code still has over 100,000 lines of
German-language comments; those are now being targeted with the help of
a script which repurposes the built-in language-guessing code which is
part of the spelling checker.

Nice! :)
