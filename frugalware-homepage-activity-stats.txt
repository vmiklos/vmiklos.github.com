That's interesting. My feeling was that recently the popularity of Frugalware was not increasing but staging, but then I had a look at the apache logs and checked the number of hits one days after the release of 0.9 and 1.0:

<pre>
$ grep -c '10/Sep/2008' www.frugalware.org-access_log
88223
$ grep -c '23/Mar/2009' www.frugalware.org-access_log
216817
</pre>

So it seems we recently get way much more hits than previously. Interesting.
