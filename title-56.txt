slowly but xorg7 is being packaged and if everything works well, it'll hit -current before 0.4pre2. currently you can get the buildscripts, and there are two binary repo:
<pre>[xorg7]
http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/other/xorg7/frugalware-i686
</pre>
and
<pre>[xorg7]
http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/other/xorg7/frugalware-x86_64
</pre>
the buildscripts are available in <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/krix/xorg7/">krix's repo</a>

warning: these pkgs are more unstable than the pkgs usually in -current!
