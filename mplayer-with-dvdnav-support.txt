i've uploaded an updated mplayer package to <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/bmf/">my repo</a> which includes dvdnav support to mplayer. at the moment it seems you need to

<code># pacman -R codecs</code>

otherwise mplayer will crash

many thanks to <a href="http://onebithq.com/root/mplayer/dvdnav">Otvos Attila</a>, the dvdnav patch author for his help (two additional build fixes was needed for our "enable everything what is possible" mplayer configuration)

hopefully we'll figure out soon how to resolve the conflict with the binary codecs, too :)
