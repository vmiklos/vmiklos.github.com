So after I upgraded to Linux-2.6.33 my wifi card stopped working after resume. I way lazy and I had no time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method">bisect</a> it, so I just ignored the problem for a while, then today I looked up the lkml thread and bingo, an <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/msg/a3b71c903e3c7bc9">easy workaround</a> is there. ;)
