Given that a lot of KDE3 apps are not just ported to KDE4 but replacement projects have been created, the upgrade is not trivial. I always declare myself as somebody who is a minimal KDE user saying I mostly just use konsole, but that's not really correct. From time to time I use the following apps as well:

<ul>
  <li>kmix (systray icon)</li>
  <li>klaptop (systray icon)</li>
  <li>kxkb (systray icon)</li>
  <li>krdc</li>
  <li>kaudiocreator</li>
  <li>k3b</li>
  <li>ksnapshot</li>
  <li>kpdf</li>
  <li>konqueror (for GUI mounting of USB sticks, when I don't use pmount)</li>
</ul>

And that really doesn't belong to here, but I still use gtk-based apps for browsing and picture viewing (firefox and gqview).

I hope this post will be able to serve as a good personal checklist when we merge kde4 to current. ;)
