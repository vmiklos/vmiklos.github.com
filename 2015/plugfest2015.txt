Last week I went to Zaragoza to give a talk on
https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/libreoffice-how-we-handle-interoperability[how
LibreOffice handles interoperability] at Protocols Plugfest Europe 2015 on
http://www.protocolsplugfest.com/europe/program/[Tuesday]. Although I was told
this conference is a successor of the previous Zentyal Summit (and I were not
there) the conference seemed well-attended -- proof above. :-)

Jacobo also
http://blogs.igalia.com/jaragunde/2015/05/11/speaking-at-protocols-plugfest-2015/[gave
a LibreOffice-related talk] on Wednesday.

On the same day, there were some explicit spare time, so I took the
opportunity to walk in the historical parts of the city, see
https://www.flickr.com/photos/vmiklos/albums/72157673233248251[my
photos] and a link:/panoramas/zaragoza.html[panorama] if that kind
of pictures are of your interest. FWIW, http://www.hotelsauce.com/en/[Hotel
Sauce] has free wifi in the rooms, that's kind of impressing for a two-star
category. ;-)

As usual, thanks https://libreoffice-from-collabora.com/[Collabora] for sponsoring this travel!
