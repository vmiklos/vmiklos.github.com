The first ever UK LibreOffice Hackfest took place in the city of Cambridge on
May 21st to 23rd (Thursday -> Saturday), kindly hosted by
https://libreoffice-from-collabora.com/[Collabora].

My starter idea was to fix
https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90315[tdf#90315], i.e. to
support both nested tables and multiple columns with the proper spacing in
between them in the RTF import. For comparison, here is how this looked in
LibreOffice 3.4:

The table borders looked OK due to correct column spacing, but the nested
table is missing. Then here is the LibreOffice 4.4 state:

Nested table is OK, but the table borders are strange due to incorrect column
spacing. Finally here is how it looks like now, when the import result is
correct:

Other than this, here is a list of other topics I hacked on:

- https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=dev-tools.git;a=commit;h=9107601036fc9af9e67b37f0fc26296dddfd6eb1[clang
  libtooling-based compiler tools] (so far an example analizer and a rewriter)
- some
  https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=tree;f=libreofficekit;hb=HEAD[gtktiledviewer]
  tweaks like handling of the "Search key not found" or the "Page count changed"
  callback event
- https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commitdiff;h=821b72886f1e407a492f881a2efb27ead2c22b5c[o3tl::make_unique],
  till we can't use C++ 14 std::make_unique

After fixing two more less interesting regressions, now it seems we're down to
0 for the
https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&keywords_type=allwords&product=LibreOffice&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&short_desc=RTF&short_desc_type=allwordssubstr[regressions
having RTF in their summary], which is promising. :-)
