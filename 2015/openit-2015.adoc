On Saturday I gave a talk at the http://openit.eventbrite.com/[Open IT 2015]
conference about the new features of LibreOffice 4.3 and 4.4.  My uploaded
slides are available
https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/4-dot-4-es-kiadasban[here].

Thanks https://www.uni-obuda.hu/en[Óbuda University] for hosting us, it was a
great event! Other than talking to the usual suspects like
http://zolnaitamas.blogspot.com/[Tamás Zolnai] or
https://plus.google.com/117194932353487735021/posts[Gábor Kelemen], I enjoyed
two OpenStreetMap talks: it was extermely cool to hear that finally the
http://turistautak.hu/[turistautak.hu] community
http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Hungary/Import%C3%A1l%C3%A1s/turistautak.hu[changed
their license] in February so that all their free maps can be imported to
OpenStreetMap -- finally one pointless fight ends.
