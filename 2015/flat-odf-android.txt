While LibreOffice's Android port has as good support for ODF as the desktop
version, flat ODF was lagging behind. There were two reasons for this:

- https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commit;h=9aa6ec9bfaa3c76c291ab8ec9a1b87fb89b817e6[flat-ODF-related
  services were simply missing] from the .apk, for historical reasons: when
  the .apk limit was 50MB, it sounded like a good idea to leave these out if it
  allowed packaging e.g. editing-related services.
- https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/gitweb?p=core.git;a=commit;h=1956b50e3b4c63a913151fd21d21c42cd288173d[flat
  ODS was blacklisted explicitly], from the times when Calc tiled rendering
  was missing, and when .ods was included again the document browser, .fods was
  forgotten.

With these two fixes my favorite test documents (of which the ODF version
worked already previously) in flat ODF version also load properly in all
Writer, Calc and Impress -- as can be seen on the above montage of
screenshots.
