People say that using bitfields in structs is slow. Of course it reduces memory usage, but the aritmetic is slower than just using pointers.

But my real problem is that if a struct uses bitfields, I can't just pass foo-&gt;bar as a pointer. And I hate that. When migrating ls-files to parseopt, I needed to write 3 extra callback functions just because of this.

Grr.
