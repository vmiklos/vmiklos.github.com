So there is a one-liner fix I sent <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commitdiff;h=405923761a8cd12d0047c215b69df9c6aa96723e">yesterday</a> in the git-clone manpage. It was funny, because I tried to parse that sentence about 3 times, then realised that a coma is missing, then it made sense to me. ;-)
