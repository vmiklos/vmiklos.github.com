I just got my freedesktop.org git account, since ooo-build is moving there from svn.gnome.org. The interesting part is account maintainance - basically I had to submit my gpg key and as long as I gpg-sign my messages, I even can change ssh keys via email, automatically. That's nice, but the reply to my messages are weird - they are gpg-encrypted, but not in a way mutt can automatically decrypt.

They note in the wiki that they borrowed the account admin system from Debian - problem located. :P

Snip. When I created the tmp libwpd-java homepage, I used hilight in asciidoc documents to color Java code. The syntax used to be:

<pre>
[java]
source~~~~
foo
source~~~~
</pre>

Now I needed this feature again and it seems that the recommended (required?) syntax is something new (tested with c++ only, as I needed that one):

<pre>
[source,cpp]
----
foo
----
</pre>
