I just got some time to upgrade GHC to 6.10.whatever in Frugalware-current, and it seems they managed to create some screwed up bootstrap binaries, linked to lineedit. This is some BSD version of GNU readline, we did not even had it packaged and the docu says it's outdated in most distros. :-P

However, we still want to bootstrap using upstream binaries, so now we use it. At least I was able to get rid of the ugly LD_LIBRARY_PATH hack, caused by the old readline library they linked the binaries in the previous series.
