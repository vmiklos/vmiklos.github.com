<p>when you send a mail from genesis, sometimes you get the following reply:
<code>mail@addr.ess
   Delay reason: SMTP error from remote mailer after RCPT TO:<mail@address>:
   host mail.addr.ess [1.2.3.4]: 450 <foo@genesis.frugalware.org>:
   Sender address rejected: unverified address: connect to
genesis.frugalware.org[157.181.177.34]:
   Connection refused</code></p><p>the solution is simple, but not trivial. it depends on the user-agent you use, in mutt, you should put the following magic line to your muttrc:
<code>set use_envelope_from</code>
then i'll be ok again :)</p>
