no, don't except anything, just started to work on it. a few infos:
<ul>
  <li>you need m162 to apply the ooo-build patches, but in that milestone the <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=63816">"fpicker module dependency" is missing</a>, but it is already fixed in upstream. so let's start to make a patch</li>
  <li>you need to download the cvs:
<code>cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.services.openoffice.org:/cvs co -r SRC680_m162 OpenOffice</code></li>
  <li>then find the last change to the critical file:
<code>cvs diff -r 1.6 -u automation/prj/build.lst</code></li>
  <li>using this patch, the build is still running atm :)</li>
</ul>
