<p>we were <a href="http://bugs.frugalware.org/408">requested</a> to provide a <a href="http://freenx.berlios.de/">freenx</a> package. in fact, this was not too easy. after ~3 days of work, now <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages.php?id=5388">nx-x11</a>, <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages.php?id=5390">nxproxy</a> and <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages.php?id=5393">freenx</a> has been uploaded. finding a working opensource client was a bit difficult and 90% of the howtos recommend the binary crap, but finally <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages.php?id=5394">knx</a> has been uploaded. thanks crazy for the hint about the knx package</p><p>ps: yes, i plan to write a howto on this topic, hopefully i'll have time to do so on the next week. till now here is a <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/pics/shots/nx.png">screenshot</a> :)</p>
