<p>my problem was that (especially on some mailing lists) i use different signatures. with the folder hooks this can be solved in a very nice way. so i have 2 signatures: a default one and a special (for a given mailing list):</p><p><code>folder-hook . set signature=~/.signature
folder-hook special set signature=~/.signature.special</code></p><p>and now when i write a mail/reply from that folder the special signature is used :)</p>
