i'm currently testing firefox-2.0. here are a few issues:
<ul>
  <li>dpi is set to -1 by default</li>
  <li>the "default homepage" setting has changed</li>
  <li>the backspace button no longer works as it used to be</li>
</ul>

the first 2 will be fixed in the package, but the last one won't since this is the way the firefox developers decided. in case you want the old way (like me), you'll need the followings:
<ul>
  <li>open a new tab and type about:config</li>
  <li>search for browser.backspace_action</li>
  <li>set the value from 1 to 0</li>
</ul>
and now it'll work like before :)
