there was an effort about generating the packages' post_install (and other) scriptlet functions dynamically. this is done via using the magic<pre>Finclude gnome-scriptlet</pre> command. the parameters you can includes <code>_F_gnome_schemas()</code>, <code>_F_gnome_scrollkeeper</code>, <code>_F_gnome_desktop</code> and so on. where it was possible the original scriptlet has been removed and now automatically generated. enjoy! :)
