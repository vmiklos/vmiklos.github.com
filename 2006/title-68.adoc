<p>i always was lame to the advanced usage of chanserv - and now again, i had to do something. the task was simple: set up autovoice'ing for a channel at freenode</p><p>so the two magic command:</p><p><pre>/msg ChanServ LEVEL #chan SET autovoice 1</pre>
and then for each user:
<pre>/msg ChanServ ACCESS #chan ADD username 1</pre>
that's all ;)</p>
