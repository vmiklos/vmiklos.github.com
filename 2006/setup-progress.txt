<p><ul>
  <li>grubconfig now uses os-prober to detect other operating systems, this means for example the boot parameters of an other existing installation are detected, or the proper title is set if you have a Microsoft installation</li>
  <li>kernel bumped to 2.6.17</li>
  <li>parted is now available - you can resize your fat/ext3 partitions on the fly from the setup</li>
  <li>ssh is available on the setupcd</li>
  <li>on tty5 there is a small nice tetris in case the installation would be boring - thanks slin for this :)</li>
</ul>
atm i've tested the 20060619 <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current-iso/">images</a> with a simple base-only installation</p><p>ah, and if we're at it (just because it's a frequently asked question):
<ul>
  <li>i've installed base to a 500mb-sized partition (no, not bigger!)</li>
  <li>booting up the system took 20 secs</li>
</ul></p>
