<p>i'm sorry to say, but it seems our free tools are not yet ready to build netbeans. first you need to add the gcj.jar to the classpath (patch <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/netbeans-gcj.diff">here</a>), but that's basically usual. then the compilation fails with the following casting error:
<code>[repeat] java.io.IOException: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.xerces.dom.DocumentImpl cannot be cast to gnu.xml.dom.DomDocument</code>
(full log <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/logs/netbeans-5.0-gcj.log">here</a>)</p><p>that's something i can't fix.</p>
