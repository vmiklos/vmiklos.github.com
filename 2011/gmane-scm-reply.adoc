SCM commit mailing lists are handy in case you want to comment others' commits
in an email. OTOH they are problematic, as they generate a lot of mails, and in
case I subscribe to the list, usually I don't read those commits at all. (In
case you have time to read them, that's a different use case.)

So here is an example how to reply properly -- without having to subscribe.

- http://search.gmane.org/search.php?group=gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.scm&query=b863767bd1ddc2af18900fa1df0cd61ef2fa6edb[search]
  for the commit ID you want to comment (here b863767bd1ddc2af18900fa1df0cd61ef2fa6edb)
- extract the article ID associated to the push from the link (here 1643)
- http://download.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.scm/1643/1644[download]
  the article in mbox format, so you can reply to it from mutt (or your other
favorite MUA).
