title: KDE 4.6 vs hibernate

We recently merged KDE 4.6 in Frugalware -current and since now it uses
`upower`, it catches the sleep button of my netbook. The problem is that
it tried to suspend instead of hibernation - what I wanted.

The trick is easy, but not really obvious. First, I disabled
suspend/hibernate in
`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/org.freedesktop.upower.policy` so that I
can play with this without actually hibernating/suspending the system.

Second, I went to System Settings -> Input actions -> Global, selected
"KDE services" and there you can see Suspend and Hibernate as well. Go
to Hibernate, and set a custom shortcut: it will ask if you want to
remove the sleep button from Suspend - the answer is obviously yes.

Done!
