title: bitlbee-skype now supports groups

I released bitlbee-skype 0.9.0 today. The last feature that triggered
the relase born in git during the last two days: now it reads and writes
Skype group info. This means if you have a Skype group "work", then you
can just `/j &work` to see work contacts only, and `/invite` also works
in that channel as expected.

More in the http://wiki.bitlbee.org/UiFix[BitlBee wiki] and in the
