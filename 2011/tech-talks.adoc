First, I was recently recommended
http://linuxconfau.blip.tv/file/4696791/[this systemd video], a record
of Lennart's presentation at linux.conf.au, I liked it.

Second, I just realised Junio (the maintainer of git) went Google last
year, as he states this in a
http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/geek-time-with-junio-c-hamano.html[recent
interview]. OK, I don't really follow closely git development anymore,
but good to know he now works on this not only one day a week. :)

Finally, I just saw http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Olx3EvJMl0[Michael's
FOSDEM talk]. I was innocently just watching it, then was surprised to
see my name http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Olx3EvJMl0&t=13m22s[here]
and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Olx3EvJMl0&t=17m51s[there]. ;)
