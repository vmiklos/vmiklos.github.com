One typical migration people do when changing phones is migration of contacts
and calendar items. In case of mine, this is about migrating data from an S40
phone to Google apps, where every smartphone can sync from.

Migrating calendar items is easy: gammu can save the data from the phone to a
`.ics` file and Google Calendar can just import that.  The situation is a bit
harder for the phonebook, as Google Contacts would take a `.csv`, while gammu
as its own ini-like format for storing this data.

I already found http://dblaci.hu/wammu2csv.pl[a script] doing something
similar, but the result was unusable. ;) Given that the whole task is not that
complex, I decided to write my own converter, available
