- BitlBee: a patch for skyped got http://code.bitlbee.org/lh/bitlbee/revision/848[merged], helping to avoid the cryptic openssl error messages when the certificate is missing.
- openSUSE: the mutt package now https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/93695[contains] one more patch from Frugalware's mutt-ng package, which means my mutt config can be used unmodified (no more unknown config settings)
- jBPM and bpm-console: these were part of my https://github.com/vmiklos/msc-thesis/downloads[MSc thesis], github branches https://github.com/vmiklos/jbpm/tree/5.1.x-thesis[are] https://github.com/vmiklos/bpm-console/tree/thesis[available], upstreaming is https://github.com/droolsjbpm/jbpm/pull/43[in progress] (on IRC they confirmed that they are interested in the feature, at least)
