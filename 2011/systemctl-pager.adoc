If you use systemd, you know `systemctl`. That's the command that
controls systemd: you can use it to start, stop or list (and so on)
services. Now in case you use list, there is a lot of output, probably
it won't fit your screen. git already invented auto-paging, which means
it'll feed its output to a pager if the output is more than a screen,
for example when using `git log`. With my
https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/0736af98c6fae9c7d31e3dd17589421b7e883ef5[recent
commit] this now the case with systemctl as well. :)
