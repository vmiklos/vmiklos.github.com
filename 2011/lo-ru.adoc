I got https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33478[a report] about
two problems which got fixed in master now.

The first error is triggered, if you have special (in RTF terms, so for
example `{` or `}`) characters in style names. The result was not so
friendly when you opened such a document:

After applying the
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/writer/commit/?id=1482475880c2902d8e041bdc211fc52afd4a7efb[first
fix], the document was imported but the original
&#1058;&#1077;&#1089;&#1090; text was replaced by something
non-unicode:

The
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/writer/commit/?id=a37fae128b4badc8f9f2201e28dca3e08948ddec[second
fix] addresses this, and now the result is the expected one:
