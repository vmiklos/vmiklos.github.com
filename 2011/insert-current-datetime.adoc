There was an old Calc
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30714[bugreport] about this, and
it was an interesting challenge, since I never touched Calc code before.

First, the references:

- http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/insert-the-current-date-and-time-in-a-cell-HP003056107.aspx[English Excel help]
- http://office.microsoft.com/hu-hu/excel-help/az-aktualis-datum-es-ido-beszurasa-cellaba-HP003056107.aspx[Hungarian Excel help]

Given that there is no easy way to enter Ctrl-Shift-";" using a Hungarian
keyboard, the Hungarian equivalent is Ctrl-Shift-".".

Actually, once http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nMCjBx7-T4[this feature] will be
implemented, not sure how the Hungarian users will access it. :)
