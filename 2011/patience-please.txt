So Lennart already had
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/hinter-den-kulissen.html[great slides] about
what is the preferred attitude when you're hacking Free Software (don't expect
gratefulness && be grateful), but recently there was such a great example, I
wanted to mention it. :)

So I saw there is a new etckeeper release and I checked its changelog,
http://joey.kitenet.net/code/etckeeper/#code-etckeeper-news-version-0.58.default[mentioning
me]. What the hell? I didn't contribute anything to that project in the past 3
years! It turned out it was a patch that was considered "too new" at that time,
but now got merged. ;) Remember, if you contribute, usually integration takes
much less time, so no need to whine about it.
