Back in April I had the idea to merge my `bitlbee-skype` plugin to the
main BitlBee project. The reason is simple: BitlBee does not really have
plugins (basically my Skype plugin was the only one) and because of
this, ABI compatibility was not guaranteed, so I usually had to rebuild
or even fix it after each BitlBee release (though Wilmer was helpful in
case I was in doubt). Today this is all past, the plugin is
http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/changeset/devel%2C802[part of the main
BitlBee repo] I won't make separate `bitlbee-skype` releases anymore.

I'm quite happy this little peace of software did not get lost, but now
is in the hands of an active maintainer again. :)
