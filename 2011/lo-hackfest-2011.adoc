We were in Munich during this weekend, and I think all of us had great
fun, kudos go to the organizers! If you are curious, there is a growing

features implemented during the event.

Update: Oh, and I forgot to mention that we (Andras and me) especially
thank the http://fsf.hu/[FSF.hu] foundation for funding our travel!
