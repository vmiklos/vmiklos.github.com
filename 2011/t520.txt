So I'm testing a ThinkPad T520 for about 3 weeks now.

My motivations were:

- so far I was using a netbook as my primary desktop, but recently did
  too much hacking on it, so I needed something more powerful
- it's interesting how many people I respect is a happy ThinkPad user,
  so I wanted to join the fun
- I got fed up with not having any 3D acceleration on the netbook, I
  wanted back the sane Intel VGA that requires no blob drivers and still
  satisfies a non-gamer, like me
- sometimes I did miss a larger screen, while 12" is handy, hacking in
  Eclipse (when I have to), watching a movie with family, etc is not
  really optimal

The official homepage is
http://shop.lenovo.com/us/notebooks/thinkpad/t-series/t520[here], the
exact model I got has the following spec:

- display: 15.6" WUXGA FULL HD (1920x1080), AntiGlare
- cpu: http://ark.intel.com/products/52219[Intel Core i7-2630QM 2,0]
- memory: 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3, 1333MHz
- hdd: 500GB, 7200rpm, SATA
- dvd writer
- vga: Nvidia Quadro NVS 4200M, 1024MB + Optimus
- wireless: 802.11a/g/n
- bluetooth: 2.1 + EDR
- card reader: 4 in 1 (SD, SDHC, SDXC, MMC)
- interfaces: 3xUSB2.0, 1xeSATA/USB2.0 combo, fingerprint reader,
  1xRJ45, 1xExpressCard/34, 1xDisplay port, 1xVGA, 1xmic, 1xheadphone
- webcam: 1 Mpixel
- battery: 9 cells, 94Whr, marketing says 14h
- warranty: 36 months

What I did not test:

- Nvidia
- fingerprint reader
- RJ45, eSATA, ExpressCard

Driver support: every portion works with Linux 2.6.39 without installing
any external drivers, except the out-of-core vga.

Notes:

- the cpu is an x86_64 4-core 2GHz (in case the above link would became
  404), so far it seems that enabling hyper-threading just causes
  trouble, once I turned that off, I no longer got random failures when
  doing multithread builds
- I considered SSD but so far I think it's too new technology for me,
  probably I'll consider for the next machine
- luckily the Nvidia card in it did not cost too much, since it would
  just eat my battery, one of the first things I did was to enable the
  in-core intel vga
- the external vga port is nice, when I plug the external monitor in, a
  KDE gui pops up and manually typing `xrandr` commands seems to be
  unnecessary
- the wireless works fine with the iwlagn Linux kernel module, but so
  far I was unable to connect to hidden access points (need to debug
  later, I only use advertised ESSID + wpa2 on a daily basis)
- the fingerprint reader is a joke, I did not try this one, but with a
  similar model it seemed to work 9 times from 10 cases, but in case it
  did not, repeating the read did not help and finally you just had to
  type in your password
- battery: with my usecase, it's around 8h when I do nothing
  cpu-intensive, otherwise around 3h
- my mini benchmark: build of LibreOffice master took more than 24h on
  my netbook, now it's under an hour, an in case there were minimal
  changes only (so ccache has many hits), it's around 20 minutes -- and
  that includes installing the product and running the testsuite as well.
