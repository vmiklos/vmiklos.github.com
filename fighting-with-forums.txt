We recently had to move forums.fw.o to a new machine and first boobaa offered a hosting. I had only ftp access, but that isn't a big problem - the bigger one is that we have this mailing list - forums two-way gateway and we failed to configure it. They have virtual domains / mailboxes on the machine (using SQL) and the machine kept rejecting mails sent to the forums by the mailing list. After debugging for about a day, we decied to just move it an other box where there are no virtual announts, and I just had to add some trivial aliases to /etc/postfix/aliases.

Sigh.

OTOH, Frugalware 1.0rc2 is out, and now we can continue bugfixing. :-)
