<p>Today evening gitte collected a summary of his tailor problems, which I would call a nice collection.</p><p>He says:</p><p><pre>
01:31 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: tailor was limited in many ways.
01:31 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: one, basically branch per branch.
01:32 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: two, it was written in Python
01:33 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: three, it did not define a language, but a
                     class interface
01:33 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: four, it made assumptions about the internal
                     organization of SCMs
01:33 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: five, it is maintained in a darcs repository,
                     which tailor cannot even convert to Git.
01:35 &lt; gitte&gt; vmiklos: oh, and it did not help that the configuration
                     is awkward and badly documented, not to mention
                     inconsistent with regard to the types of input/output
                     repositories.
