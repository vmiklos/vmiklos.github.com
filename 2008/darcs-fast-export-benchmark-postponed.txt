Once that is resolve, I hope I can do a comparision.</p><p>Snip. I like the new asciidoc-8.3.0, now math expressions can be defined using the latexmath :: [] macro inline. ;-)</p><p>Snip. I like how people can say the usual "if you need it, send a patch" sentence. Today's version:</p><p>"It's not very high on my list of priorities,
