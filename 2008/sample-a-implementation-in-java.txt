I got this exercise at the uni, and I thought it's easier if I split the problem: first the logical one (implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*#Algorithm_description">pseudocode from Wikipedia</a> in Python) then the RTFM one (figure out the right Java API).

Of course I wasted the whole evening by not starting working on it, so it was 0:30 when I started. It took about 2 hours to do the <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/gitweb/?p=ai2k8.git;a=blob;f=1/hazi.py;hb=HEAD">Python implementation</a>, and then again two hours to transform it to Java. And of course the code is two times longer. Guess what? One of the guy I talked today was surprised about how short my Java code is. :-P

BTW, the day before I finally got to write <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/gitweb/?p=darcs-fast-export.git;a=blob;f=git-darcs;hb=HEAD">git-darcs</a>. An old vision that is now reality. :-)
