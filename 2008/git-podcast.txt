in <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/88784">this</a> mailing list post, the recent gsoc podcast is linked, which is actually about git. two times my project is explained as well, about 11m14s and about 26m09s.

it's usually hard to describe to people what i'm doing in my project, maybe this'll help a bit? :)
