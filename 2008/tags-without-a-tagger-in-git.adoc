<p>So this came up on IRC: ancient tag objects in git have no "tagger" line, and thus converting such a repo with git fast-export is not possible. And the usual way - I just <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/103470">reported</a> it on the mailing list and Dscho quickly provided the necessary patch.</p><p>I hope the ubuntu guy (who is in CC) will at least give Dscho a "thanks", but who knows if it'll ever happen..</p>
