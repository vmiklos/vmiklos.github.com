<p>Started to work on a python26 WIP repo. About 400 packages will need a rebuild, so it'll be fun. I'll publish all the needed scripts here when I'm done - though most of them is in a "use once, then trow away" style.</p><p>While waiting for the above scripts, I also started to work on converting git's builtin-apply to parseopt. Ideally it would be trivial, but it really have a lot of options, so probably I won't finish that today, either.</p>
