<p>yesterday somebody mentioned on #git <a href="http://www.gitcasts.com/posts/railsconf-git-talk">this talk</a>. it's not a real video, just audio + slides but it's really nice. i would say if the "Linus one" made you say "heh, this may worth to check out" then this one will be the "hey, this one prevented me from learning things the hard way".</p><p>it's just one hour and it describes so many important tricks that i haven't encountered elsewhere yet.</p><p>just watch it.</p>
