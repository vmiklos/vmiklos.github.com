<p>So today I had a test at the uni with a lot of formula and given that it was boring to learn, I created a cheat sheet using asciidoc. The fun part is that the just released asciidoc 8.3 not only supports inline tex expressions but (using -a latexmath) supports rendering most of them to html as well.</p><p>I bookmarked a few related useful howtos on delicios, and my 14-page-length doc is available <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/doc/asciidoc/math/">here</a> (source, pdf, html).</p><p>I also like the new table format. The only buggy thing seems that I always have to scale images down, 100% results in a size about 200% somehow. Ah and the url escaping stuff I just <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/f78e952e0b8be822">reported</a>, but that's not a problem here.</p><p>I hit it while building Git v1.6.1-rc1, released today. The toplist of that is interesting:</p><p><pre>
