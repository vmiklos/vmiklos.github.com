<p>It seems that even if you use backsticks around tilde in asciidoc manpages, it will disappear from the text when you generate the manpage.</p><p>The git asciidoc.conf already has a {tilde} macro exactly for this purpose, so when a topic about the buggy git-daemon manpage came up on IRC, <a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=git/git.git;a=commitdiff;h=4fce51cf415909be84e3a1449900e3fdea775b76">the fix</a> was almost trivial.</p><p>In other news, I managed to write some OpenGL code to display a sphere without using gluSphere(). The result is not that interesting, since it matches the output of the original utility function. ;-)</p><p>(Quite a "reinvent the wheel" story, but my next exam at the uni on Monday will be like this, ie. solving problems without using glu* and such...)</p>
