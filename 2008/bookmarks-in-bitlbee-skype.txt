Yesterday macmaN on #bitlbee poked me about how would it be possible to rejoin existing groupchats after connect automatically. It turned out that Skype has support for Jabber-like bookmarks, and it wasn't too hard at all to <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/gitweb/?p=bitlbee-skype.git;a=commitdiff;h=17809b7f0dbf6977544243eb36ed6a3c1caea8c5">implement it</a>.

I want this to settle down then I'll be ready to release 0.7 next year, I hope.
