<p>I just sent out a <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/102733">patch</a> to add support for generating the pdf version of the git user manual. I (and some of the guys at the uni - just discussed recently) prefer reading long docs in pdf, rather than in the memory leaker firefox.</p><p>We'll see how it'll be accepted.</p>
