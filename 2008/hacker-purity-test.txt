<p>I just found <a href="http://www.armory.com/tests/hacker.html">this test</a>, it's an old one, almost 20 years old. It's funny to see what questions became outdated and which didn't.</p><p>Some of my favorite questions:</p><p><ul>
  <li>Do you complain when a "feature" you use gets fixed?</li>
  <li>Ever mask an NMI?</li>
  <li>Do you own more than 16 floppy disks?</li>
</ul></p><p>Of course the last one is because I still do have more than that - though I no longer have such a reader at home - would have to go to work to read them. ;-)</p>
