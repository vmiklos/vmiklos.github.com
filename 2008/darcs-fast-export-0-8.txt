<p>Whoa, lots of stuff happened.</p><p>darcs-fast-export 0.8 is out and it passes the big-zoo test. (In short AFAIK darcs2git goes to an infinite loop for big repos, the others just produce corrupted results, and d-f-e is the first that can pass that test.)</p><p>I just noticed a bit expensive (since you'll be billed an international fee), but useful sms2irc method, by using <a href="http://www.sms4skype.net/skype/smstoskypeen.asp">sms4skype</a> + bitlbee-skype. :)</p><p>Oh and a trick. We at Frugalware use a hook to update the working dir after every push, so that the new (in git 1.6.1) warning when pushing to a non-bare repo is bogus. The way to disable it is in git-config, manpage, but here it is:</p><p><pre>
git config receive.denycurrentbranch ignore
</pre></p>
