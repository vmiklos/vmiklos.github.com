<p>While rebuilding for Python-2.6, libbtctl <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/logs/libbtctl-0.10.0-2-i686.log">FTBFS</a>, and it turns out the problem was that old-style ".pub" signature. We'll see how upstream will welcome the <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/frugalware/frugalware-current/source/gnome-extra/libbtctl/mono2.patch">patch</a>, but at least that solved the problem for us at Frugalware.</p><p>In fact that .pub sign must be ancient, I did the csharp bindings for Pacman-G2 a long time ago and then I already did not use the old form, either.</p>
