<p>I've just added a <a href="http://progetti.arstecnica.it/tailor/ticket/171#comment:3">new comment</a> to the previously mentioned ticked. In short, it seems that darcs what -s --xml is horribly broken, and tailor heavily relies on this, so darcs-fast-export did.</p><p>I just removed this for now - maybe later I'll write my own patch parser, but that does not have a high priority in my TODO.</p><p>I want to cut a release in case all the test conversions in the "darcs-benchmark" repo passes fine, but that will take 2-3 days, I guess.</p>
