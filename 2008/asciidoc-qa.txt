OK, given that I want to build the Git User Manual 1.6.1-rc1 with Asciidoc 8.3.0, I continue the story started yesterday. The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/msg/e4c4b65a92f7980a">new bug</a> seem to have something with attribute handling, whitespaces in references and quotes, pick your favorite one.
