I created a toy project to experiment with a few technologies I wanted to try
out (https://cmake.org/[cmake],
https://github.com/google/googletest[googletest],
https://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/[xmlsec] outside LibreOffice,
https://libzip.org/[libzip] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor]). The
result is a tool with a similar interface as pdfsig from poppler (for PDF
files), just for ODF: a cmdline executable to verify the digital signature(s)
in an ODF document.

The https://github.com/vmiklos/odfsig[source code] now has CI on Linux and
Windows, so perhaps in a shape that is interesting for others to have a look
as well. And if not, then no problem, it was interesting to put together these
building blocks and see them working as expected. :-)
