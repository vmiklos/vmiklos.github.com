Yesterday I gave an
https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/event/ode_epub_export/[EPUB export in
LibreOffice Writer FOSDEM] talk at FOSDEM 2018, in the
https://fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/open_document_editors/[Open document
editors developer room]. The room was well-crowded -- perhaps because the next
talk was about LibreOffice/Collabora Online. ;-)

Quite some other slides will be available on
http://planet.documentfoundation.org/[Planet] I expect, don't miss them.
