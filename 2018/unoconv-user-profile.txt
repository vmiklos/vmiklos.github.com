Background: I was benchmarking Online vs jodconverter vs unoconv the other day
for Collabora's https://www.collaboraoffice.com/document-conversion/[document
conversion] page. One problem with measuring unoconv performance was that it
provided no ways to run multiple `unoconv` processes in parallel, while the
underlying `soffice` binary obviously allows this.

So while `unoconv` is not capable of launching the `soffice` process in a chroot
(improves security), nor is capable of forking an already pre-initialized
`soffice` process (improves performance, both are things Online can do for you),
there is no real reason why you should not be able to run multiple `unoconv`
processes in parallel. The previously mentioned benchmarking would be quite
unfair if even this kind of multiprocessing would be ignored, but unoconv had
no way to specify a custom user profile, which has to be different for each
`soffice` process.

So I filed a https://github.com/dagwieers/unoconv/pull/451[GitHub pull
request] on 1st Jun, and finally it was merged on 10th Aug.

Here is how you can use it for example:

----
unoconv --user-profile /tmp/tmpf_yreswi -f pdf --port 2002 test.txt
----

NOTE: It's your responsibility to give --port a unique value, but that's not
too hard: if you use a thread pool to launch the `unoconv` processes, then you
can add the thread index to a base port and that will give you a unique port.

So this is available in unoconv master (towards unoconv 0.8.2+1), you can grab
the sources from git and try it out right now. :-)
