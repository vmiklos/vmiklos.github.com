Earlier today I gave an
https://conference.libreoffice.org/2018/the-program/sept-18th-friday/[Editing
ReqIF-XHTML fragments with Writer] talk at LibreOffice Conference 2018. The
room was well-crowded -- perhaps because the previous talk was about OOXML
interoperability. ;-)

I expect quite some other slides will be available on
http://planet.documentfoundation.org/[Planet], don't miss them.
