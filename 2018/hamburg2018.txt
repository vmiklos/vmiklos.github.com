I arrived home from Hamburg yesterday where I participated in the
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Hamburg2018[LibreOffice hackfest]
over the weekend as a mentor. First, thanks to The Document Foundation -- and
all the http://donate.libreoffice.org/[donors] who made this work possible.

There were a few topics I mentored:

- Patrick was interested fixing
  https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=116486[tdf#116486],
  which required some background knowledge on the Writer document model and
  layout, so we explored the relevant details together towards providing an
  actual patch for the bug.

- Nithin wanted to fix
  https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112384[tdf#112384],
  which turned out to be an ideal task for a hackfest. On one hand, the scope is
  limited so that you can implement this mini-feature over a weekened. On the
  other hand, it required touching various parts of Writer (UI, document model,
  UNO API, ODF filter), so it allowed seeing the process of adding a new
  feature. The https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/52561[patch] is merged to master.

- Linus looked for a task that is relatively easy, still useful, we looked at
  https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42949[tdf#42949], and he
  identified and removed a number of unused includes himself. This should
  especially help with slow incremental builds. Again, the
  https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/52594[patch] is already in master.

- ZdenÄ›k (raal) wanted to write a uitest for
  https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=106280[tdf#106280] so we
  were figuring out together how to select images from pyuno and how to avoid
  using graphic URLs in uitests in general.

The full list of achievements is
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Hamburg2018#Achievements[on the
wiki], if you were at the hackfest and you did not contribute to that section,
please write a line about what did you hack on. :-)

Finally, thanks for the organizers and the sponsors of the hackfest, it was a
really great event!
