It has been proposed on the list that we switch from medawiki to dokuwiki.

Pros: an active developer would maintain it, dokuwiki is maybe a bit less bloated

Cons: obscure syntax, for example the title '=' syntax (= is big, == is smaller) is the opposite of what we use in asciidoc.

So far dokuwiki is packaged in current, so we'll see...
