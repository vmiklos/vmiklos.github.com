syncpkg is a small script to sync packages on an given arch. an example: you're on x86_64 and you have foo-1.0 while there is already foo-2.0 in darcs, then it'll find this package, build it and if the build was successfull, i'll upload the package

the only parameter it requires is the max pkgs you want to build (if that number is too high then it may start to build pkgs others already built)

$ tail -f build.log

number of pkgs to build: 99
