++++
so the python25 repo has been finally merged to -current

we have rebuilt ~155 packages, hopefully everything is fine now again :)

there are 2 kde packages to fix, they will be done by crazy soon

oh and there is a new test in the testsuite to avoid that big number of hardcoded python versions in the FrugalBuilds :)
