I've contributed a patch to repo.or.cz to allow darcs imports, but and I recently got a reply for it from the maintainer. So we worked together a bit more and now the patches <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/girocco.git?a=search&amp;st=author&amp;s=vmiklos">are in</a>, repo.or.cz just imported the source of <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/darcsweb.git">darcsweb</a>.

I also created a test project and tested that incremental imports work properly as well. \o/

NB: It uses my darcs-fast-export tool, that's why I started to work on this. ;)
