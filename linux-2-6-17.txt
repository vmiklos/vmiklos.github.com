has been uploaded, all the external modules are updates (or where it's broken, the m8rs are working on it). unfortunatelly swsusp has been disabled, but don't worry, it's already fixed in darcs, so if you really need it <em>now</em> and can't wait till 2.6.17.1, then use the usual <code>repoman merge kernel</code>
