Though Paul already stated on qemu-devel that kqemu is completely unmainainted, our kqemu pkg stopped working after we updated to qemu-0.10. And funny enough, there is a new version on nongnu.org which works with the new version. So it's now updated, even if I did not really expect a new release of it ever... ;-)
