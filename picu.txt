So today I wanted to try out how to do a mass-upload of pictures to Picasa.

<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Picasa-Data-API/browse_thread/thread/cbbc37ccc911c133?pli=1">This message</a> links the script itself, and after installing the gdata.py package, it works almost fine. It assumes that your google account ends with @gmail.com, which is really false in my case, but the code itself is quite simple, so you can work around this bug.

It would be nice if it would be possible to upload the picture subtitles as well this way (from a notes.txt or so), but for now I just hand-added them, it's not that difficult.
