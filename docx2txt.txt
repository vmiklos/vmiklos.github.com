So there is <a href="http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net/">such a project</a>, and my relevant ~/.mailcap entry is:

<pre>
$ grep docx ~/.mailcap
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document; docx2txt.pl %s -|iconv -c -f utf8 -t latin2; copiousoutput;
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.documen; docx2txt.pl %s - |iconv -c -f utf8 -t latin2; copiousoutput;
</pre>

I don't exactly know why the later is needed. I haven't checked the RFC. The fact is that sqmail sends the content-type header using format=flowed (no indication about using this format, it just uses it), and mutt doesn't like it. So it's an sqmail or mutt bug. But the workaround is the second entry above.

BTW I started to learn Erlang yesterday, there is a good "Programming Erlang" book, it's more than 500 pages, I managed to read the first ~50 pages.

OTOH Fruglware 1.0rc1 is out. Laying in the bed and releasing from my iBook is fun. :)
