Did you ever notice the <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validator</a> does not support HTTPS? I sent two patches (<a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2002/css-validator/build.xml#rev1.17">ant dependencies fix</a>, <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/2002/css-validator/org/w3c/css/css/DocumentParser.java#rev1.5">SSL Host verifier fix</a>) to its devel list a while ago and they are now in CVS, hopefully they will soon upgrade their service as well. :)
