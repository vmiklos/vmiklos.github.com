today finally i passed one of my exams so i had time to update our udev package. why is this so important? as of kernel-2.6.15 the hardware detection is now <a href="http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=a7fd67062efc5b0fc9a61368c607fa92d1d57f9e">really simple</a>. this allows us to wipe out the whole (very slow) hotplug script, and use only udev as a hotplug multiplexer (almost) without any workarounds. on my machine this  causes the hardware detection to be about 10 times faster than before. as usual, a simple pacman -Syu should do everything for you, if you use -current.
