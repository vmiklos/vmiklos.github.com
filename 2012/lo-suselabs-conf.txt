I spent the last two weeks on two conferences:

- LibreOffice Conference in Berlin, where I https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/how-to-add-a-new-writer-feature[gave a talk] (it is promised that there will be even a video record available later)
- openSUSE conference in Prague, where I just attended.

In general, thanks for the organizers for these fantastic events!

A few fun facts I discovered during the conference:

- Armin is referred in the source tree as AW due to... well, it's easy to find out once you heard about OD's ORW reincarnation. :-)
- `solver` stands for "solar version", it does not solve anything (read Michael Stahl's talk for details)
- I just discovered http://www.openoffice.org/marketing/ooocon2006/presentations/wednesday_d12.odp[this] presentation of Thorsten, slide 15 mentions a bug on x86, which is still the case on Android, 6 years later.. (even mentioned in Tor's talk)
- "Java? I hope that language dies" (Jan Engelhardt, openSUSE Sparc guy)
- "Browser: we're there; Office: with LibreOffice -- even if it's not perfect, we're getting there. Groupware: we're weak here" (Georg Greve, Kolab guy)
- Don't try to change EUR to CZK in the Prague main station, they have ridiculously bad rates
