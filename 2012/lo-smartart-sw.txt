You may remember that LibreOffice 3.5 learned to
http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/3.5#Impress_.2F_Draw[import
SmartArt] in Impress. In LibreOffice 3.6, the same is now true for Writer:

Note that just like in Impress, Writer produces far from perfect result is the
prerendered output of the diagram is not present in the document. In practice,
we can open files produced by Word 2010 just fine, but problems with Word 2007
are expected.

In case you way to play with this feature, a test document is
