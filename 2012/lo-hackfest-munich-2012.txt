During the weekend I was in Munich to visit our second LibreOffice hackfest
this year. The archivements are detailed
http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Munich2012#Achievements[here]. Here
are a few interestings details I learned during this event:

- Laszlo explained on the train to Munich that single line spacing is 15% of
  the font size, by definition. That finally explains why it is that the height
  of a 12pt single-line paragraph in Writer is not 240 but 276 twips.
- Finally Michael motivated (and also helped!) me to improve the copy&paste in
  the new RTF filter, so it seems that removing the old filter completely is
  near.
- The ability to sign each other's gpg key was a great idea. I didn't know too
  much about this topic, so I read up on this
  http://www.phillylinux.org/keys/terminal.html[here]. (Additionally, the
  `gpg-key2ps` command from `signing-party` -- yes, there is such a package! --
  is useful.)
- We set up a nice icecream farm from the laptops, one more aspect that boosted
  our productivity.

Speaking about icecream -- there were two reasons why I didn't really use it:

- it required re-configuring your build tree (`--enable-icecream`)
- it required shutting down your firewall

It turns out none of this is really needed, so let me share the way to avoid
these problems:

- look into the
  https://en.opensuse.org/index.php?title=Icecream&oldid=53112#Firewall[wiki], you only need to open a few ports, even broadcasting/auto-discovery works with a started firewall
- use `CCACHE_PREFIX="icecc" make build-nocheck PARALLELISM=30` to enable icecream for a single make run

Additionally, if you run openSUSE 12.2, by default the daemon reports that the
box can't compile x86_64 binaries (probably it hasn't been updated to deal with
the 3.0 kernel or something), a quick workaround is to install Lubos' updated
package:

----
zypper -p http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/llunak:/clang/openSUSE_12.2/ in icecream-0.9.7-64.1s.x86_64
----

Thanks for the organizers, once again this hackfest turned out to be really useful! :)
