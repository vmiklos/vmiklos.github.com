The Hungarian Linux in the Education Conference 2012 was held today @ Budapest,
I held a generic session about LibreOffice
(https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/libreoffice-whats-new-whats-next[slides]), also talked a few
guys into submitting Easy Hacks. ;)

Other interesting stuff: a free

in PyUNO by Laszlo, available http://numbertext.org/logo/[here].
