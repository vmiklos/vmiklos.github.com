The Hungarian Linux in the Education Conference 2012 was held today @ Budapest,
I held a generic session about LibreOffice
(http://vmiklos.hu/odp/libreoffice-lok-bp-2k12.pdf[slides]), also talked a few
guys into submitting Easy Hacks. ;)

Other interesting stuff: a free
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29[Logo] interpreter
in PyUNO by Laszlo. (It's supposed to be available
http://numbertext.org/libreoffice/[here], but that's not yet the situation.)
