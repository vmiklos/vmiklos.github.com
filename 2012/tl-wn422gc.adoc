The http://www.tp-link.com/en/products/details/?model=TL-WN422GC[title] is a
wireless card usable for desktop machines. Why I can recommend it:

- It's better than those cheap wifi stricks, having a high(er) gain antenna.
- It has proper Linux support. Kernel module name: `ath9k_htc`, the required
  `htc_9271.fw` firmware is part of `kernel-firmware`, so it works out of the
   box on any modern distro.
