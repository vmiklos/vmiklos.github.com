The Free Software Conference 2012 -- orginized by FSF.hu -- was held today @
Budapest. I gave a talk about hacking on new Writer features
(https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/hogyan-keszitsunk-uj-writer-funkciokat[slides]).

We (with Andras) also ran the LibreOffice booth, and in idle cycles I also had
time to kill

annoying bug]. This year speakers got a t-shirt and a fine lunch, thanks for
the organizers! :)
