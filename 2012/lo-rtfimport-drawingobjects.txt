It all started with https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42407[this
bugreport] about a year ago. RTF has two different markups to describe shapes.
The old one (used till Word 6.0) is called Drawing Objects, the new one talks
about Shapes. The first picture shows the "support" for this syntax in
LibreOffice 3.4, and the situation did not change with my RTF import rework, as
I wasn't aware of any document still using this old syntax. So when I got this
bugreport, I knew it'll take some time to produce the correct layout, but now
during the LibreOffice conference I spent quite some time on this, and at the
end even the Hebrew text is imported correctly. ;-)

Thanks to Lior who politely nagged me from time to time, this is now available
on master (see the second picture), which will become LibreOffice 4.0.
