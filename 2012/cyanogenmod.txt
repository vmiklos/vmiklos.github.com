So even if I http://vmiklos.hu/blog/galaxy-s[bookmarked] a thread to have a
look at the CyanogenMod install on my phone last year, I didn't have a look at
that till yesterday. The final motivation was that I thought that CM 9.1 (not
containing any Samsung code) will not be vulnerable wrt.
http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Remote-resetting-a-Samsung-phone-made-easy-1717115.html[the
issue reported 2 days ago]. Later turned out that installing
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voss.notelurl[this app] is
enough, even if you stick to the older firmware supplied by Samsung, but once
CM was installed, I haven't looked back.

The
http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S:_Full_Update_Guide[install
guide] was easy to follow, it seems that newer Samsung devices have download
mode enabled by default, so you need no cracking, the ClockworkMod Recovery and
then CyanogenMod can be installed without any problems. Probably the only
nontrivial part is that you do want Google Apps, even if you disable most of
that stuff later, as the Play Store is part of that collection as well.  As the
guide suggests, I made a full backup, then after the install I restored the
important part of my settings.

For the reference, here is how my home screen looked before and after the
reinstall:
