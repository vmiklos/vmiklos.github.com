I think the first attempt to track LibreOffice RTF Writer regressions (bugs not
presenting in some earlier versions) was in
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/27680[this]
mail. That started with 14 bugs, and of course while I fixed a few, new ones
were added as well. I guess this is mostly due to testing work, since new fixes
are usually covered by unit tests, so re-introducing the same problems
nowadays is a bit more work.

I remember I was down to one regression a few months ago, but we still had
performance problems, which
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=a48e2fd9049797110b3b2505c363557284987ca8[got
solved] a few weeks ago, so I had the idea that I want to go down to zero
during the holidays. It seems today I finally managed to do so -- bugs tagged
as `rtf_filter` and `regression` are gone, thanks everyone who helped! :-)

For the reference here are the queries:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&keywords_type=allwords&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&query_format=advanced&status_whiteboard=rtf_filter&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEEDINFO[RTF
regressions],
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&keywords_type=allwords&status_whiteboard_type=allwordssubstr&query_format=advanced&status_whiteboard=rtf_filter&bug_status=RESOLVED&list_id=196270[fixed
RTF regressions],
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=dorem&remaction=run&namedcmd=Writer%20regressions&sharer_id=14344[Writer
regressions].

Now that the list is empty, feel free to tag more bugs as `rtf_filter` from the
long Writer list when needed.

Update: the list is now empty again, as of 2014-11-24, for the 4.4 release. ;-)
