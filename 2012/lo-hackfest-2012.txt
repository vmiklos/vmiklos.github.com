We were in Hamburg during this weekend, and I think all of us had great
fun, kudos go to the organizers! If you are curious, here are the topics I
worked on besides mentoring when I was asked to do so:

- http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=0ef7dbc[implemented docx import of even/odd page breaks]
- http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=8adbd3d[implemented docx import + rtf import/export of the zoom setting]
- http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=5187174[implemented \bin rtf keyword]
- http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=fd2cb15[added testcase framework for rtf export] (thanks a Markus for helping that!)

Also thanks Stefan for
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=b32ae7f[correcting] the
misleading icons of the horizontal/vertical flipping in Writer. ;)
