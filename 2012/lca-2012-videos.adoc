I think last year it was the
http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/lca2011-video.html[systemd video] I watched,
now it was btrfs. Especially the
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxWuaozpe2I#t=16m50s[can't you do online
corruptions?]" part. ;)

Also: did you know the `filefrag` and `sum` commands? (e2fsprogs, coreutils)
