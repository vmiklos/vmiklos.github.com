You probably have read that ooo-build has been <a href="http://www.documentfoundation.org/contact/tdf_release.xml">renamed</a> to LibreOffice (technically it's just a rename).

Test packages for i686 available <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/ooo33/frugalware-i686/">here</a> if you want to test it on Frugalware.

Aaand this time, as a very special gift, ppc packages are <a href="http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/ooo33/frugalware-ppc/">available</a> as well! :)

I just built it, but Bouleetbil was kind enough to provide a <a href="http://dors.frugalware.org/libreofficeppc.png">screenshot</a> when he tested it.
