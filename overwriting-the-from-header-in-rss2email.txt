So here is the <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/rss2email-reply.patch">patch</a> that allows you to do it.

Basically it is useful when the blog has no comment functionality, as in this case you can just specify an address in config.py, like:

<pre>
OVERRIDE_FROM = {
                'http://landley.net/rss.xml': '''"Rob Landley's blog thing." &lt;rob@landley.net&gt;'''
                }
</pre>

Without the patch you can just overwrite the name, not the address as well.
