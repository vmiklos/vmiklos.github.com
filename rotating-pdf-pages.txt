So I wanted to rotate each page in a pdf file clockwise using pdf2ps, pstops and ps2pdf. Actually I haven't figured out how to do so, even if I already used pstops (which is cryptic for the first time) multiple times so far.

Sure, I know ideally how to do it, but then I just got blank pages.

But pdftk seem to do it properly:

<pre>
pdftk in.pdf cat 1-endE output out.pdf
</pre>
