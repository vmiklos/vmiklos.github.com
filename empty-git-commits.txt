long time no blog ;)

in darcs, tags are empty patches which depend on every patch since the previous tag + the previous tag. so tag is shown in the changelog itself

in git, tags are just pointers to existing commit objects. for example 1c77ec3 already exists, then you say let's call this 1.0

you may want to create darcs-like tags in git. of course this won't be the git way, but it's nice to see that the git core allows you to do so

so here is what you need:

<code>
echo "tagged 0.9.2" |git update-ref HEAD `git commit-tree HEAD^{tree} -p HEAD`
</code>
