We hit <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/asciidoc/browse_thread/thread/fd27add515597c06?pli=1">this bug</a> after I upgraded asciidoc on the server where we build the Frugalware documentation, luckily I just had to backport the given patch from hg and it now works fine.

I like how responsible the upstream (Stuart) is. Asciidoc is not bug-free, but as long as one provides simple reproducers, he quickly fixes bugs, yay! :)
