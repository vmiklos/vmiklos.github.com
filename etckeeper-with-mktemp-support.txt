etckeeper recently started to depend on tempname which is like mktemp, but we don't have it in Frugalware.

I recently sent <a href="http://frugalware.org/~vmiklos/patches/etckeeper-update-ignore.d-01update-ignore-add-support-for-mkt.patch">this patch</a> to Joey (the etckeeper maintainer) to add support for mktemp.
