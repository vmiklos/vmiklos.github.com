I just released 0.8.4. The happy thing about it is that basically the
only fix I added to this release is to make it work when python is
python3k (so we need to use python2.7 to get python2 support), but the
rest is just merge from:

- email
- github
- Debian

Now the total number of contributors increased to 7. :)
