Today I had some Hungarian mathematical logic notes to type in Latex,
and again I had to dig up the various references to get the proper
symbols I needed.

I used the following pages:

- ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/doc/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf[amsmath] is unique
  in that for example it explains how to use `\begin{cases}`
- http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/Symbols.pdf[this one] is
  a collection of lot of symbols, I found `\mathcal` here
- An http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_symbols[article from
  Wikipedia] about logic symbols
- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics[The Math chapter] of
  the well-known LaTeX wikibook
- http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/Theorems.html[A set of
  macros] making easy to declare lemmas, definitions, proofs.
