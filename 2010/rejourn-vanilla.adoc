One may have noticed that right now my
http://vmiklos.hu/gitweb/?p=rejourn.git;a=summary[rejourn tree] is
empty. That's not an accident, after Ram accepted my 15th patch, finally
the site runs an unpatched version of link:|filename|/2010/rejourn.adoc[rejourn] - of
course with a custom config and design.

Of course I still have a few ideas on what to improve, so this is not
the end of the story, but still - I'm happy he was so open for changes
and new features that we reached this post. :)
