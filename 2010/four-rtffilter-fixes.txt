<p>During the week I got some feedback from Oliver Specht on my GSoC work. I decided to dedicate a whole day to address those issues (these were all regressions compared to the old RTF exporter). Here are the results:</p><p><ul>
  <li>Numbering indentations were problematic, this is now <a href="http://hg.services.openoffice.org/cws/vmiklos01/rev/697e294cb900">fixed</a>.</li>
  <li>Outline numbering was missing, <a href="http://hg.services.openoffice.org/cws/vmiklos01/rev/9f6a7c44c7d8">fixed</a> as well.</li>
  <li>Explicit character style support was missing, I now <a href="http://hg.services.openoffice.org/cws/vmiklos01/rev/d37003e71907">implemented</a> it.</li>
  <li>Finally (which was the most time-consuming), text frames were now exported, this is now <a href="http://hg.services.openoffice.org/cws/vmiklos01/rev/b935ac15ff37">implemented</a>, too.</li>
</ul></p><p>One remaining question is that he mentioned something is problematic with the table of contents export, but I could not reproduce the bug so far.</p>
