<p>I've been testing <a href="http://frugalware.org/packages/103074">anyremote</a> during the last week. I'm aware that there is kanyremote and ganyremote available, but I wasn't really interested in those, since they would hide the glory details. :)</p><p>So I decided to give the server mode mode a try and I choosed okular as a test application. My commandline is:</p><p><code>anyremote -s bluetooth:19 -f /usr/share/anyremote/cfg-data/Server-mode/okular.cfg</code></p><p>Once I started the server on my notebook I could choose it in the midlet on my phone in the j2me client and it worked as expected.</p>
