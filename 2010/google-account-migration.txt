The whole story starts
http://www.google.com/support/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=182075[here].
The whole conflict is about I had a google account with my vmiklos.hu
domain already, but now the google apps account took it over and they
asked me to rename the old account to something else.

I joined the early adopter program and I was happy about it, finally I
could access Picasa with my google apps account, though I could not make
it to picasa.vmiklos.hu or something. But at least I could use it.

Why I'm writing is that now they changed something regarding google
groups as well, since I just noticed I can no longer post to the
invite-only lists hosted on google groups where I use my personal
address... It turns out the trick is to get the old (renamed) address
unsubscribed and get the new one subscribed.

I'm not really claiming, since the new state is much more clear, but
this unsubscribe + subscribe dance is rather uncomfortable...

Oh, and a related

decided not to use it).
