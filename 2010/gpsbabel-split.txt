title: How to split gpx files using gpsbabel

I usually just download the gpx track from my GPS and delete the track
from device each time I arrive home and I was at some interesting place
before. Last week this was not the case, I was at
http://maps.google.com/?q=Gy%FAr%F3,+Hungary[Gyúró] two weeks ago, then
I borrowed by device, without clearing the log from it.

So the task was easy: I had a timestamp and I had the full log from the
device, and I want to split it: before and after a given timestamp. It
turned out that I had some log from Oct 28th as well, so I wanted:

- The log till Oct 28th
- The log between Nov 5th and 8th
- The log after 10th.

Luckily the
http://www.gpsbabel.org/htmldoc-1.3.0/filter_track.html[gpsbabel
documentation] is quite clear in this area (see Example 4.8), I just
needed the following commands:

----
$ gpsbabel -t -i gpx -f in.gpx -x track,stop=20101028 -o gpx -F out1.gpx
$ gpsbabel -t -i gpx -f in.gpx -x track,start=20101105,stop=20101108 -o gpx -F out2.gpx
$ gpsbabel -t -i gpx -f in.gpx -x track,start=20101110 -o gpx -F out3.gpx
----

Update: two more notes:

- the stop is exclusive, start is inclusive
- when using the result in digikam, the camera time zone has to be set to "manual: gmt+0", even if both the gpx result and the camera time is in local time
