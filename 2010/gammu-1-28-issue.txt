<p>I recently upgraded gammu from 1.27 to 1.28 in -current and I noticed that the backup of my phone is now way slower than before. The <a href="http://gitorious.org/gammu/mainline/commit/9e7b902b8b80dd953bf491e494e42865b0f232d5.patch">fix</a> was trivial (already backported to the Frugalware package as well) for the maintainer so it's now fine again.</p><p>Well done, mcihar! :)</p>
