<p>So I have been invited to this year's openSUSE conference in Nurnberg to give a short presentation about my GSoC work (the RTF export rewrite in LibreOffice).</p><p>As I expected, the really interesting part was to meet people I never had the ability to meet in person previously - and of course to learn other new stuff. :)</p><p>So some of the items I really liked:</p><p><ul>
  <li>We actually did some hacking, see <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/writer/commit/?id=a8e76355d980ee015162023150ae48d68fbb4124">here</a> (thanks Cedric for pointing out the issue for me).</li>
  <li>I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphs_and_trigraphs#C">trigraphs</a> - thanks Fridrich!</li>
  <li>I now heard about flat ODF from Muthusuba.</li>
  <li>Nice jokes by Tor about old UNIX systems where the default installation added a login for Kernighan and Ritchie by default. :)</li>
  <li>Met great people from the LibreOffice team (Kohei, Noel, Muthu, Cedric, Tor, Fridrich, Petr, Lubos), and outside: Stephan Kulow (coolo, the ex-kde-master) and others.</li>
</ul></p><p>To sum up: thank you for the invitation, I enjoyed it! :)</p>
