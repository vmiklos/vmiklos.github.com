So I wrote a
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/2938[short
script] to find undocumented classes in the LibreOffice source code - I
don't mean when some of the public methods are not documented, but the
case when the class itself doesn't even have a one-liner mission
statement.

Of course it should be used with care - if someone starts adding
bullshit or misleading documentation using this script, that just makes
the situation even worse.

The patch generated a nice
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/2938[thread]
where basically they argue if it makes sense to have a KDE-like API
documentation for LibreOffice or it's just better to refactor code to
have self-documenting function names, etc.

At the end of the they, looks like there are people who find it
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.documentfoundation.libreoffice.devel/3032[great].
:) (In the meantime that patch has been pushed, of course.)
