mxw is a simple C irc bot. i've start it as a fun project (usually people write irc bots in perl or python), but currently it handles more and more functions. today i've added rss support (using libmrss) so that on the #frugalware channel mxw_ floods the users with package updates and blog posts ;-)

of course the whole code is still experimental, i hope this post will appear on #frugalware, too :)
