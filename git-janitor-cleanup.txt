Mailed Christian Couder to cleanup up the <a href="http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Janitor">Janitor page on the wiki</a> a bit, since for example all the git_config_string refactoring is already done.

It's nice I did not really have to explain I do not want to destroy his work, it's just no longer necessary - he understood it just fine.
