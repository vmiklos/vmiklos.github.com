If you ever tried to use graphical bullets in Writer (Format -> Bullets and
Numbering -> Graphics), you may have noticed that only the ODF filter can load
and save such a numbering. This is now improved a lot. Motivated by seeing this
is now handled in the binary DOC filter, I now added support for this also to
the DOCX and RTF import and export filters. If you want to play with this
feature, core.git also contains a

and an

sample as well.
