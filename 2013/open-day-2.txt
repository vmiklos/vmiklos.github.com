On Monday, KAMI once again http://nyiltnap2.eventbrite.com/[organized] an event
called "Open Day 2" here at Budapest, to promote free software like Mozilla
projects and LibreOffice. I was also invited as a speaker, giving overview of
what happened in LibreOffice-land during the past few months. My slides are

Thanks for nice evening, it was good to talk again to other free software
contributors like our Hungarian Firefox and LibreOffice translator, etc. :-)
