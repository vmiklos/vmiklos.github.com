The Free Software Conference and Exhibition 2013 -- organized by FSF.hu -- was held yesterday @
Budapest. I gave a talk about hacking on Writer file format problems
(https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/libreoffice-writer-fajlformatum-problemak-es-megoldasuk[slides]), this time in Hungarian.

After the talk I also held a one-hour workshop, showing how to start hacking on LO in practice:

- first we did a build (using package manager to install dependencies, git clone, autogen, make, make dev-install)
- then we did the http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Hacking#My_first_hack[vcl Menu::SetItemText() hack] -- actually using `comphelper::string::reverseString()`
- finally I spent some time explaining a few bugfixes from the recent past: I explained a http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=a22ef599bd3fdcf0bd5c3616aa566a5922624ff3[VML import problem], an http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=3d4fef85d05269e613316a7af6245f05d207d76e[RTF import problem], a http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=4144cd5a851466778004af9de98dbcfb019067bb[WW8 export mismerge], finally a http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=f06cc552a0699f7c2c34db981e77d4c8efe5e9e7[WW8 import issue]

We (with Andras Timar and Tamas Zolnai) also ran the LibreOffice booth. This
year speakers got a free t-shirt and lunch, thanks for the organizers! :)
