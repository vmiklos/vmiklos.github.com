It was pointed out that LibreOffice Writer is only able to open, not save
`.dot` (Word binary template) files. From mso-dumper experience, I knew that
the difference is quite small between `.doc` (which we already export) and
`.dot` files. The feature freeze for LibreOffice 4.2 is here next week, so why
not adding this feature before that deadline? You can see above the result. :-)

For the ones who love our `--convert-to` commandline switch, an extra fix was
necessary to make `--convert-to dot` work as well, both commits are now in
master. You can try it out yourself using a
http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/[daily build] or just wait for the
`libreoffice-4-2` branchoff and the first beta from that branch.

Happy templating! ;-)
