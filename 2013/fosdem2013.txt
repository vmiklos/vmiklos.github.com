We spent the last weekend in Brussels, at FOSDEM 2013. Outside attending great
talks, I most enjoyed meeting people I haven't met in person before, in no particual order:

- http://www.bitlbee.org/[Wilmer van der Gaast]
- https://developers.google.com/open-source/[Cat Allman]
- http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/User:Od[Oliver-Rainer Wittmann]
- http://picobot.org/[Phil Muldoon]
- http://0pointer.de/blog[Lennart Poettering]

Also fixed https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=48440[fdo#48440],
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58646[fdo#58646] and
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=59419[fdo#59419] during
less-interesting talks. ;-)

Additionally, during the last day we had time for some site-seeing, some
pictures are
