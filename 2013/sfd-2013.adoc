This year's Software Freedom Day event was held yesterday at Szeged, here at
Hungary. I gave a talk about the news of LibreOffice 4.1 / 4.2
(https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/4-dot-2-es-kiadasban[slides]), and I was
happy to notice there were other LibreOffice-related talks as well:

- Péter Mátó was talking about
  http://sfd.org.hu/egy-uj-magyar-fejlesztes-koezponti-rendszer-menedzsment[central
  configuration management], the LibreOffice-related bit is
  http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=5a02076358a547bae8a9b596d9722a7cd2d46c34[this
  commit];
- László Németh was talking about a
  http://sfd.org.hu/magyar-wollmux-platformfueggetlen-intezmenyi-vallalati-dokumentumkezeles-nyilt-szabvany-szabad-szoft[LibreOffice
  extension], but in practice he shared quite some details about how to
  contribute (and his usual topics like LibreLogo ;-) )

I would like to thank the organizers all their work, it was a pleasure to
attend this event! :-)
