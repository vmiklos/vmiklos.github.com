It's All Souls' Day, so let's celebrate it by writing Free Software that helps
us to remember our ancestors. I already enjoyed
http://ancestry.com/[ancestry.com] as a GEDCOM editor, but it always just shows
a small part of the family tree. So here comes
https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot[ged2dot], that will convert your GEDCOM file
to a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph[DAG], resulting in a
layout similar to this:

Of course you can also feed more sensitive info into it, like disabling
anonymous mode: then it'll show the name and birth/death date on the nodes;
it'll also show something more useful than placeholder images. ;-)
