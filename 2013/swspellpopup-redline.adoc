If you ever had to review a document that had change tracking enabled in
LibreOffice Writer, you might have noticed an odd behaviour: if e.g. the
inserted text has a spelling error, it's not easy to reject that change. The
reason for this is that in case of spelling errors, right mouse click activates
the spellcheck popup menu, which lacked the change tracking operations
previously.

As you can see in the above screenshot, this is no longer an issue: LibreOffice
4.2 will have the previous change, next change, accept change and reject change
operations in the spellcheck popup menu as well.

In one sentence, with LibreOffice 4.2, Writer allows to reject a spelling error
it detected itself. ;-)
