You may remember that I wrote about my little
link:/blog/ged2dot.html[ged2dot project] about two months ago.
It's a Python script that can be used from commandline with quite some
options. I'm happy to announce that there is a GUI for it now, in the form of
a LibreOffice Draw import filter. If you open
https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot/blob/master/test/screenshot.ged[this GEDCOM
file], you'll see something similar to the above image.  You can simply build
the `.oxt` from the https://github.com/vmiklos/ged2dot[Git repo], or just get
it from the
http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/gedcom[LibreOffice
Extensions site].

Technical details for the interested readers: the import filter just glues
together existing pieces. First it runs `ged2dot`, then `dot` to generate an
SVG. To keep things simple, then the filter "inlineizes" all the included
images, finally the already existing SVG import filter does the real work. I
find it elegant that each step works from and to the memory, and not ugly
temporary files. :-) It works on Linux and Windows, feedback on if it works on
Mac is appreciated.

Also, if you ask why this is an extension, not part of LibreOffice core: I
guess most users are not interested in building family trees; also being
someone who works on the core most of the time, I wanted to try out how
implementing an import filter as an extension (filter detection, import
options dialog, etc.) works. ;-)
