This year, LibreOffice's Hamburg hackfest happened last weekend, with more than
20 attendees. Thanks to the
https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Hackfest/Hamburg2013#Sponsors[sponsors], we
had free drink and food during the whole hackfest. ;-)

My original plan was to add support for tables inside text frames
in Writer, when importing from RTF. At the end I managed to do that, though not
the way I originally wanted to implement that feature. :-)

Here is how this looked with the RTF importer we inherited from OpenOffice.org (LO 3.4),
and then with the new RTF import filter (LO 3.6):

Here is how this looks like in latest master, and how it should look like:

Other than that, there were a few other topics I hacked on:

- various additional fixes for
  https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=58819[fdo#58819], so watermark
  is exported (with correct size, position, rotation, opacity, etc.), and
  reasonably imported
- the last character of the git hash is no longer missing from the about dialog
  (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=216fe5cf3c41713fa2a11731e4c3d514236b2480[commit])
- number of leaking files when running the writer filter tests is now down to 2
  from 527
  (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=c03a1e46460e4255d7709df9ba8147947f66acfb[commit])
- RTF import of text frame's AutoSize property
  (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=aa0f3ca1cd285e8ffbc10de5510d447a72de980a[commit])
- File -> Properties -> Security -> Record Changes is now imported and exported
  in the RTF filter
  (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=ae85b56a9a18657a57fd5033faff34e7ee4ff2f8[commit])
- finally added UI for fine dashing -- so not only existing documents are
  rendered correctly, but you can create such documents as well
  (http://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/core/commit/?id=4c3d2dcdadbcb8f2ffc2caab07d50a286341df96[commit])

Last, but not at least, thank you Eike and Bjoern for organizing this event! :-)
