Yesterday Novell Hungary organized
https://www.suse.com/hu-hu/events/suseconf2013/[SUSE Conference 2013] here at
Budapest. As you can see above Andras held a LibreOffice-related presentation
there -- and we also ran a LibreOffice booth. As it was requested, we set up
quite some
(http://dev-builds.libreoffice.org/daily/master/Android-ARM@24-Bytemark-Hosting/current/[publicly

- Impress remote
- LibreOffice4Android (document viewer) on my phone (I needed a

to get it running on a non-tablet, though)
- The desktop app on a tablet -- thanks goes to the organizers who provided that for us!

About 200 visitors attended the conference, which counts as a great success in
this category. :-)
