This year's LibreOffice conference was held in Milan, Italy. Links to my slides:

- https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/gsoc-students-panel[GSoC students' panel] (I only organized this one)
- https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/vim-efficient-code-search-and-pretty-printing[VIM: efficient code search and pretty-printing] (Lighting Talk)
- https://speakerdeck.com/vmiklos/git-crash-course[Git crash course]

Why so many talks? I couldn't decide what topic to pick up (git or Writer
filters), so I did both, the rest -- those weren't sessions where I spoke for
30+ minutes, so those don't really count. :-)

Regarding the number of attendees, draw your own conclusions from the

made on 26th -- probably more than 100 attendees, counting all days.

Thanks for the organizers for this beautiful event -- and also the sponsors,
including Google (free food/beer during one hackathon) and CloudOn (fee
free/beer during the other hackathon + tablets for the best commits)!
