LibreOffice Writer had an old limitation we inherited from OpenOffice.org
times: if a document started with a table, it wasn't possible to select the
whole document text. There were various bugreports for this problem:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37606[one] from more than 2 years
ago, an https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=7747[other] from 2002 (!)
-- and I'm happy to post screenshots about how I improved this in LibreOffice
4.2 (before and after):
