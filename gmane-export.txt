OK, this was silly.

Yesterday I wanted to reply to a post on the swig mailing list. I found the post on nabble.com, which is way worse than gmane.org, but - I guess - due to SEO black magic Google prefers the previous. So I searched for the mail on gmane.org, appended the usual /raw to the mail, but I still did not get a mbox, to feed it to mutt. Given that I had no idea what do to, I just simply wrote an mbox header, then mutt was able to open it.

And finally it turns out that gmane <a href="http://gmane.org/export.php">has a nice export feature</a>. Duh! ;-)
