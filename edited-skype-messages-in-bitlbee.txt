title: Edited skype messages in BitlBee

A user reported on #bitlbee that in case someone edits an already sent message using the Skype GUI client, BitlBee does not report the change. This used to work for about 2,5 years ago, but now I checked and true, it was broken. When I fixed it I realised that it would be nice to prefix the updated message with something to be aware that it's an edited message, not a new one. The result is pushed out to the git repo and a <a href="http://vmiklos.hu/project/bitlbee-skype/shot/011-edit-prefix.png">screenshot</a> is available as well. ;)
