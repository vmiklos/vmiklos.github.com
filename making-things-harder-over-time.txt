So it's interesting that firefox 3.5 now requires one more click if you want to accept a self-signed cert. I think it's now at 4. And this means that a non-addict user basically won't be able to access those sites, it's already way more complex than what is acceptable for an avarage user.

An other interesting aspects is version control. With SVN, you did only 'svn diff, svn up' and if both were a no-op, then you knew that you can start to work. With darcs, one more command was necessary due to local commits: 'dr what, dr pull, dr push'. And now with git (if you use local branches): 'git diff, git branch, git push, git pull'. (I admit that this second example can be simplified with a shell script, but still. ;) )
