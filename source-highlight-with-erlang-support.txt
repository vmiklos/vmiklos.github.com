I wanted Erlang support in the syntax highlighter used by asciidoc. Currently the filter uses source-highlight as its backend, so I checked and unfortunately it had no Erlang support. A quick google found that there is a good <a href="http://caolanmcmahon.com/erlang_syntax_highlighting">shjs support</a> which would ideally work out of the box with source-highlight. Of course it did not, but it wasn't hard to fix it up. Then I sent it to upstream. This was about a month ago.

Then I just noticed it was <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/src-highlite.git/diff/?id=ed7a5b7bb495c8d460013454558fe687ba6a975c">accepted</a> a few days ago, and now source-highlight-3.1.2 is out, so it's back in Frugalware-current \o/
