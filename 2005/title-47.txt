<p>syncpkg is a small script to sync packages on an given arch. an example: you're on x86_64 and you have foo-1.0 while there is already foo-2.0 in darcs, then it'll find this package, build it and if the build was successfull, i'll upload the package</p><p>the only parameter it requires is the max pkgs you want to build (if that number is too high then it may start to build pkgs others already built)</p><p>$ tail -f build.log
