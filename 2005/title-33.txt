<p>during coding the setup, i noticed some strange behaviours, i debugged then for a long time ;)</p><p>so to learn from my faults:<ul>
  <li>strcat does not accepts a NULL pointer as a dest char*</li>
  <li>getenv() just gives you a pointer, you have to strdup() it if you want to modify the value</li>
</ul></p><p>an other thing: i forgot again and again what's the difference between <pre>step</pre> and <pre>next</pre> in gdb:
<ul>
  <li>setp executes the current line of the program and stops on the next statement to be executed</li>
  <li>next is like step, however, if the current line of the program contains a function call, it executes the function and stops at the next line</li>
</ul></p><p>ah, and if you want to execute the whole code line by line from the begining, you'll need <pre>break 1</pre> and then the usual <pre>run</pre></p>
