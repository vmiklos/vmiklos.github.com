<p>during the meantime (you can't always hack the setup :) ) i've figured out how to package firefox extensions. you know why this is usefull: when you have a pc with a big number of users, or where you have a lot of machine. so test packages for <a href="ftp://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/source/xapps/firefox-adblock">adblock</a> and <a href="ftp://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/source/xapps/firefox-pagerankstatus">google pagerank status</a> are available</p><p>i plan to package sessionsaver and webdeveloper, too</p><p>if you have other ideas then post the name and the url of the extension you wish!</p><p>(<a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Getting_started_with_extension_development">this</a> article served as a base to figure out how this all works)</p><p>update: webdeveloper is also <a href="ftp://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/vmiklos/source/xapps/firefox-webdeveloper">available</a></p><p>update2: it seems that session saver and weatherfox does not support system-wide installations...</p><p>update3: flashblock and user agent switcher pushed</p>
