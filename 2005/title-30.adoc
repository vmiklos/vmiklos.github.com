<p>darcs is not too funny, it's well documented so if you once read the documentation, almost nothing unexpected will happen. but today... i've found a very nice new feature :)</p><p>you have a repo. inside the repo there are dirs. some of them are not "dr add"ed. if you run dr rec/what/etc in that dirs, it will find the "partent" repo, and runs the command on it. but you can create a new repo in that not-added dir, and then dr will work on this new repo. nice, eh? :)</p>
